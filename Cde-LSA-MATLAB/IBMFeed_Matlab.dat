This certainly seems like good justification for economic development and health education in our state's poorer counties. "

If you look at the world IQ map, you will notice east Asian countries score highest, while African countries, and Australia, score lowest. Europe and central Asia are right on avg, and the Americas are slightly below. This was all based on the indigenous populations. So Native Americans for the Americas, aborigines for Australia and so on. Say what you want about the methods and accuracy, but there may be something to it.

My coktail service was outstanding however the girl did forget to wear her name tag. The dealer at BJ was funny and outgoing. Brad really provide great customer service. I did not win to much but I had fun. Later the night I went to play poker. I did very well but the dealer had very bad attitude. She was mad or just had a bad day, no smile. She was even negative about the new casino. She should be happy to have a job this days. Jackie even did not say thank you for her tips before she left our table.

"Negative Equity by State as of October 2008","Lets face it--allowing lenders to essentially securitize negative equity as PSMI secured debt is going to encourage them to do it.

"World Map of Social Networks (June 2009) ","Observers too easily ignore specialized social networks including such holdovers as USENET newsgroups and as recent as neighborhood news publishers. Probably because the press likes to focus on advertising-supported media, the better for its own prospects — or perhaps all it knows to speak about. The large networks are becoming mainly a matrix in which smaller networks can get started and become organized, but their technical limitations due to massive generality mean that functionally they are mainly dogs, as are their third-party apps. online degree | Online university | Online education "

You have all taken an abstract graphing and turned it into a national pissing contest... I'm from Georgia, and I scored 143 on the MENSA IQ test... I took it twice to be sure, so obviously intelligent people can be found anywhere one chooses to look. I'm sure this website was not founded for the purpose of state bashing, as it's being used. The Massachusetts vs. Mississippi, argument isn't even realistic! Massachusetts, while smaller boasts an estimated population of 6,497,967 people, while Mississippi is home to a meager 2,938,618 people, which means, if the same number of people did poorly in both states, then Massachusetts has a larger remaining pool to increase the average...

I think that you are prepared for most aspects, but I also fear that you are somewhat naïve about many things. But I have no real fear for your safety. I may joke about it, but I send you to the world with the thought that you will make things better for those around you. It may take you some time to find your way. There are many starts, stops, and detours in life. This is one of your biggest starts ever. Go for your dreams, my bambini, you have an opportunity of a lifetime with essentially no risk. If you want to make it in publishing, stay there until you get your first break. Persistence is the key to most things in life, along with jumping on opportunities as they are presented. Being observant and prepared for these opportunities will often place you above the competition for positions. Once you get in a place, you will start making contacts and when you do well, it gets around and new opportunities through networking will soon come around. "

"Obama Speech in Cairo - Focus on "WE"","“Naturally the common people don’t want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.” online bachelors degree | Life experience degrees "

At any rate, that is what we are going to try to do. That is the resolve of His Majesty's Government-every man of them. That is the will of Parliament and the nation. The British Empire and the French Republic, linked together in their cause and in their need, will defend to the death their native soil, aiding each other like good comrades to the utmost of their strength. Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous States have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this Island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."

Philosophers like Jeremy Bentham pointed out in the eighteenth century that the purpose of politics was to bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people.

Democrats ran this country into the ground over the last 4 years by out-voting the republicans and the presidents. When one party controls congress and the senate, then progress stalls. It's laughable how you ignorant window-lickers jump on the bandwagon to bash Bush for the economy, when he was the one who warned congress of the impending financial crisis... many many times. Get a clue, numbnuts.... This mess belongs to more than one person. "

"Electronic vs. Traditional Textbooks","You posted several data sets on electronic v traditional texts, but your data seems misleading. It is like comparing Apples to Automobiles -- a difficult comparison at best. They really are two different products. In your comparison, are the prices just the shelf cost (i.e., the cost at the point of initial purchase)? Is the cost for the 'traditional' just the new edition price? What about the used price? Also, almost all electronic versions I have seen are just a "rental" model -- meaning the content expires after X number of days (usu. 180) or after a certain date. Did you factor in the resale value which reduces cost for traditional but not print? Did you discount average the buyback price from the traditional version? Studies I have seen suggest that many students print out the electronic copies -- creating additional costs for them or their institutions. Did you figure in an average cost per print page and average number of pages printed for the electronic version? What about returns? If you drop a class, you may not be able to get any money back from the electronic version if you have opened it. What if you compared the price of electronic (a rental model) versus programs where college stores rent traditional textbooks -- you might be surprised at how much cheaper the traditional rented is than the electronic rented that you get. The Student PIRGS have done some good work on calculating the total cost of ownership for electronic textbooks. College stores have also been in favor of this comparison. Digital *may* be cheaper, but there is no guarantee. There are some digital options that are truly cheaper, and some that are more comparable to the traditional text in terms of ownership models. Your data sets should include some caveats and provide more accurate information on what is being compared. Current digital prices are also artificial -- designed to increase adoption. Many textbook publishers are not even applying basic overhead to the digital product. Once print no longer covers the cost, do you think publishers will accept lower profits and revenue by keeping electronic prices lower? Sorry -- publisher pricing models is a subject for another soapbox. "

Overcrowding, noise, lack of parking controls, undesirable neighbors urinating from three storey balconies right in front of our eyes are just a few issues we have to thank our Yarra City town planners for. During a recent IDAC meeting for a planning application for former Yarra City Councilor Paul D'Agostino (Labor) the committee unanimously carried the motion to approve a permit for a four storey apartment block. There is nothing new about apartment blocks in the North Fitzroy street that the application was proposed for. However a large group of objectors did want Yarra City Council to apply some restrictions to the permit, namely to reduce the number of levels from four to three, which prior to this application, was the maximum number of floor levels permitted in this compact street. The objectors also wanted the committee to address issues of potential parking stress which was considered an issue by the objectors. Needless to say, Steve Jolly (Stephen Jolly) was first to move that Paul D'Agostino's permit be approved. The Other Yarra councillers followed "

"Ratio of Blacks (%) in Prison to Blacks (%) by Population","Black Men in America's Jails and Prisons Too many young black men continue to waste their precious lives in a state of neo bondage. As a correctional educator for the past several years, I can tell you that the prisons and jails in this great country are overflowing with young African-Americans. All of my students are young black men - every single one. As a teacher, it saddens me to see the talent that is wasted on a daily basis. We all need to start doing more to address this esculating dilemma. The youth of this country don't need to rot in jail, while we (Americans) ignore the problem. Something is causing this horrible trend to continue. You may ask yourself ”What can I do?”. There is no easy answer, but you need to do something. A few suggestions woould be: organize sports functions (basketball leagues, football leagues, etc.) talk to kids at school write books contact government officials do volunteer work tutor kids take kids fishing, camping, etc. The point here is to start doing something. If we simply ignore the problem, where do you think we will be in 10 years pertaing to this issue? For my part, I have written a book aimed at helping young black men who are already incarcerated. The book is called:    Black Choices, A young black man's guide to prison survival                                    ISBN: 1-60813-727-9, 83 pages, 6 x 9,  The book can be ordered through       PublishAmerica.com or by calling 301/695-1707 This book can make a real difference to the young man who is incarcerated. It can help him to negotiate prison life more successfully and also start planning for what life brings after prison is over. If you have a loved one or friend in jail, consider sending him this most important book. I believe it will help his life to start getting back on the road to a more successful future. "

"eharmony complaints","I totally disagree with your statement! I too was so disillusioned with the dating scene at 45 years old. I was divorced for 4 years with 3 young sons, living in the Midwest. I had about 50 first dates from various dating methods—set ups, Just Lunch Member and another dating website. I am an attorney and stable. However, I just never clicked with anyone. I joined the EH site with skepticism but I never gave up that I would find a new, fun, loving partner. And….I did! I joined and was matched with my partner the first night. I communicated with probably 40 men in 2 weeks. I had 4 dates in 2 weeks from EH members. The other 3 men were great men that I had a lot in common with. But I just did not have the chemistry until I found with my current partner. We continue to be amazed how much we have similar likes and dislikes but have enough differences in the relationship to be interesting. (Republican vs. Democrat—many very interesting deep discussions!) We are extremely compatible in what we like to do in our free time, sexually and intellectually. Our lives have blended beautifully including our sons. I feel marriage is on the horizon but would never marry a man without dating him for 1 year. So, for all the skeptics who have given up on meeting your life partner, I say go for it. And no, I do not work for EH. Rather, it worked for us. We have never been happier. "

"Obama Speech in Cairo - Focus on "WE"","Very interesting observation, Fritz. Ironically, the text was transcribed correctly; however, the visualization technique managed to take the through out of context. The original quote is: "So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity. And this cycle of suspicion and discord must end." I guess there's a good lesson in there somewhere about data mining and visualizations. Thanks for your thoughts. "

"PlentyofFish complaints","Wow...I am sooo glad the majority of peeps do not go by this info! Re the length of time one has been on...Ever thought that...People on POF for a "long time" keep active profiles because of friends, forums, or the events? Ever thought that maybe they DATE and not SETTLE?? Is there some LAW that says you can't be single for more than xx amount of time?? Get real! Re the people with high numbers of favorites. Umm, HELLO! I hosted events AND I was constantly in the forums as a very popular poster. People just ENJOYED reading me thoroughly...there are MANY as such! I would get favorited as a "bookmark" to my profile for the latest event info and as a link to all the "good forums." Re requiring having a photo. Only the fuglies seem to ever think this is a crap requirement! Face it...MOST have to be physically attracted to someone to make a relationship work. I can be friends with a fugly...I cannot have sex with one...no matter how nice/sweet/caring/generous/honest/loyal/insert your choice adjective here, that they are. BUT...my idea of "attractive" is different...so why not take out the guessing games and just post a freaking picture already! Sheesh! I mean, have you ever connected with someone via emails and texts and felt you were lacking something cause you had no face to go with the personality? Or worse...finally see the person and KNOW you are NOT attracted to them?? Sue me! Re pics that show parts of the user other than the face. Some have talked about this becoming a requirement...a full body shot. Personally, I think we should be able to post whatever we wish. I sure can utilize such to weed out the losers who post the shirtless shots, the lingeries, etc. Ick. But nothing wrong with a CLOTHED full body shot! What's worse are the ones who SAY they are athletic and they obviously think participating in a sport or going to the gym on occassion qualifies them for such...NOT. Its a body type...a HARD BODY. Same goes with "a few pounds over." Ummm...when you have at least 15 in your fat face alone...you're more than a FEW pounds over, bub! MY gripe with POF is this. I have been a part of it for SEVEN MFing years. SEVEN. I am responsible for uber amounts of new sign ups and creating an events community. (My parties averaged 500+ in attendance.) I did this all as a VOLUNTEER. I had some green with envy skank named Sheila, who did everything she could to stalk me and ruin my repuation for a YEAR. The final straw came when she spread rumors that I have herpes! (Her username is PreviouslyMe on the site...caution...ironically SHE really DOES have herpes!) I guess she spread such cause I went on ONE DATE with someone she was nuts about but he broke things off with her. She blamed me, so of course I must have HER herpes. WRONG. A) I did not sleep with him and B) I use condoms. Anyway, I publicly announced in MY OWN THREAD that the rumors circulating were not true, and I did NOT have herpes, but the person spreading these lies, DID. I named no names. It was venting and salvaging MY character. Not the smartest move, but neither is deleting someones profile who has been loyal to the site for that long and responsible for MANY new sign ups. (thousands) The post was even ON TOPIC. I was deleted with no warning or no explanation. Poof. Oh well. Their loss. Meanwhile...how many times this girl posted public rants...how many BOGUS profiles she has on the site...just uber BS. "

"ARRA Investments by County Bubble Chart","Capital markets are unstable. In the past there was no way to make them stable. But today we have computer power that can be used to make them stable. By using the greater computer power of today we can have a much higher turn over of capital in the capital market. This higher turnover will make the market harder to game or control and the market will no longer have the unstable run ups or declines. Who can change or control the market when say 20% of the capital is trading each day? So now that we have the compute power to provide for all these transactions that will smooth out the market how do we force people to turn over at a rate of 20% a day? Easy, put a cap gains tax of 0% (zero) on all gains of 7 days or less and put a cap gains tax of 90% of all gains of more than 7 days. The likes of Yahoo, Micosoft and/or Sun Micro Systems will give us the systems that will provide automated software agents to support turning over one's investments every 7 days (based on the specs you give the agent). A system like this will make the financial markets work as smoothly as the local fruit market. "

This is why the posted emissions for 1990 add up to 513.2 Tg CO2eq, when the actual 1990 inventory total is 426.6 Tg CO2eq.

"Average Earnings By Education Level (Matrix)","Hi. I was curious to compare the male and female salaries for each combination of age and education. This visualization makes that hard, because the values are too far apart to compare them visually. I couldn't figure out how to create a matrix with nested columns, so I computed the ratios of (male/female) and visualized those. The result is here: http://manyeyes.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/visualizations/comparison-of-male-and-female-salari "
"Word Tree of Barack Obama speaks at Democratic National Convention, 8/28/2008","I don't have a clue just who Lou Pritchett is but he certainly hits the nail on the head. AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA Dear President Obama, You are the thirteenth President under whom I have lived and unlike any of the others, you truly scare me. You scare me because after months of exposure, I know nothing about you. You scare me because I do not know how you paid for your expensive Ivy League education and your upscale lifestyle and housing with no visible signs of support. You scare me because you did not spend the formative years of youth growing up in America and culturally you are not an American. You scare me because you have never run a company or met a payroll. You scare me because you have never had military experience, thus don't understand it at its core. You scare me because you lack humility and 'class', always blaming others. You scare me because for over half your life you have aligned yourself with radical extremists who hate America and you refuse to publicly denounce these radicals who wish to see America fail. You scare me because you are a cheerleader for the 'blame America' crowd and deliver this message abroad.. You scare me because you want to change America to a European style country where the government sector dominates instead of the private sector. You scare me because you want to replace our health care system with a government controlled one.. You scare me because you prefer 'wind mills' to responsibly capitalizing on our own vast oil, coal and shale reserves. You scare me because you want to kill the American capitalist goose that lays the golden egg which provides the highest standard of living in the world. You scare me because you have begun to use 'extortion' tactics against certain banks and corporations. You scare me because your own political party shrinks from challenging you on your wild and irresponsible spending proposals. You scare me because you will not openly listen to or even consider opposing points of view from intelligent people. You scare me because you falsely believe that you are both omnipotent and omniscient. You scare me because the media gives you a free pass on everything you do. You scare me because you demonize and want to silence the Limbaughs, Hannitys, O'Relllys and Becks who offer opposing, conservative points of view. You scare me because you prefer controlling over governing. Finally, you scare me because if you serve a second term I will probably not feel safe in writing a similar letter in 8 years.

"Public Social Spending as a Percent of Net National Income","Come on --- get a grip on yourself! Stop beating up the Bushes with so-called myths and look at the big picture that makes up the economy. This is just 1 sector. You first acknowledged and then just glossed over the "other economic relevancies" with your conclusion. But even in this 1 sctor...look at those countries spending 30% on socialized progams ... taxation is the only way that they can pay for this. There is NO comparison between the capitalistic system of the US when pitted against all the socialized countries. Even with the problems we have, we are still better off than just about every other country. Turkey and Mexico are under us ONLY because their economies are on the verge of collapse. Above all...quit focusing on 1 or 2 sectors of the overall makeup of the national economy and educate yourself on the several different influences that make up the total economic picture. Wake up America and get your head out of the sand! Better yet...do something construct about it! "

"CO2 Emissions Compared To Land Area (logarithmic scale)","The sunlight method guy above is a bit misinformed. I get his idea, but it just doesn't work. It would be too difficult to calculate. Besides, Northern countries have a lot of forests and forest industry. Wood products do bind CO2. For example, a wooden house may last for 100's of years. Boreal forests grow back easily after clearcuttings. Tropical forests on the other hand are often cut down and converted to farm land => lots of CO2 emissions produced. Forests don't much bind CO2 by themselves, you have to cut them, store the wood, and let the trees grow back. Naturally, this won't help CO2 balance that much. The use of fossil fuels will still cause global warming. The per land area system may be interesting, but doesn't work either. For example, Danmark (small area full of ppl) "owns" Greenland (the opposite). So Danmark is actually very low on CO2/area. You get the idea... IMO, CO2 per capita is most fair, but has problems too. We should leave these problems to the real experts. "

"Jem and Scout discuss the trial's outcome with atticus","Jem was sprawled on the sofa reading Popular Mechanics. He looked up. "It ain't right. He didn't kill anybody even if he was guilty. He didn't take anybody's life." "You know rape's a capital offense in Alabama," said Atticus. "Yessir, but the jury didn't have to give him death- if they wanted to they could've gave him twenty years." "Given," said Atticus. "Tom Robinson's a colored man, Jem. No jury in this part of the world's going to say, 'We think you're guilty, but not very,' on a charge like that. It was either a straight acquittal or nothing." Jem was shaking his head. "I know it's not right, but I can't figure out what's wrong- maybe rape shouldn't be a capital offense...." Atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair. He said he didn't have any quarrel with the rape statute, none what ever, but he did have deep misgivings when the state asked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely circumstantial evidence. He glanced at me, saw I was listening, and made it easier. "-I mean, before a man is sentenced to death for murder, say, there should be one or two eye-witnesses. Some one should be able to say, 'Yes, I was there and saw him pull the trigger.'" "But lots of folks have been hung- hanged- on circumstantial evidence," said Jem. "I know, and lots of 'em probably deserved it, too- but in the absence of eye-witnesses there's always a doubt, some times only the shadow of a doubt. The law says 'reasonable doubt,' but I think a defendant's entitled to the shadow of a doubt. There's always the possibility, no matter how improbable, that he's innocent." "Then it all goes back to the jury, then. We oughta do away with juries." Jem was adamant. Atticus tried hard not to smile but couldn't help it. "You're rather hard on us, son. I think maybe there might be a better way. Change the law. Change it so that only judges have the power of fixing the penalty in capital cases." "Then go up to Montgomery and change the law." "You'd be surprised how hard that'd be. I won't live to see the law changed, and if you live to see it you'll be an old man." This was not good enough for Jem. "No sir, they oughta do away with juries. He wasn't guilty in the first place and they said he was." "If you had been on that jury, son, and eleven other boys like you, Tom would be a free man," said Atticus. "So far nothing in your life has interfered with your reasoning process. Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Tom's jury, but you saw something come between them and reason. You saw the same thing that night in front of the jail. When that crew went away, they didn't go as reasonable men, they went because we were there. There's something in our world that makes men lose their heads- they couldn't be fair if they tried. In our courts, when it's a white man's word against a black man's, the white man always wins. They're ugly, but those are the facts of life." "Doesn't make it right," said Jem stolidly. He beat his fist softly on his knee. "You just can't convict a man on evidence like that- you can't." "You couldn't, but they could and did. The older you grow the more of it you'll see. The one place where a man ought to get a square deal is in a courtroom, be he any color of the rainbow, but people have a way of carrying their resentments right into a jury box. As you grow older, you'll see white men cheat black men every day of your life, but let me tell you something and don't you forget it- whenever a white man does that to a black man, no matter who he is, how rich he is, or how fine a family he comes from, that white man is trash." Atticus was speaking so quietly his last word crashed on our ears. I looked up, and his face was vehement. "There's nothing more sickening to me than a low-grade white man who'll take advantage of a Negro's ignorance. Don't fool yourselves- it's all adding up and one of these days we're going to pay the bill for it. I hope it's not in you children's time." Jem was scratching his head. Suddenly his eyes widened. "Atticus," he said, "why don't people like us and Miss Maudie ever sit on juries? You never see anybody from Maycomb on a jury- they all come from out in the woods." Atticus leaned back in his rocking-chair. For some reason he looked pleased with Jem. "I was wondering when that'd occur to you," he said. "There are lots of reasons. For one thing, Miss Maudie can't serve on a jury because she's a woman-" "You mean women in Alabama can't-?" I was indignant. "I do. I guess it's to protect our frail ladies from sordid cases like Tom's. Besides," Atticus grinned, "I doubt if we'd ever get a complete case tried- the ladies'd be interrupting to ask questions." Jem and I laughed. Miss Maudie on a jury would be impressive. I thought of old Mrs. Dubose in her wheelchair- "Stop that rapping, John Taylor, I want to ask this man something." Perhaps our forefathers were wise. Atticus was saying, "With people like us- that's our share of the bill. We generally get the juries we deserve. Our stout Maycomb citizens aren't interested, in the first place. In the second place, they're afraid. Then, they're-" "Afraid, why?" asked Jem. "Well, what if- say, Mr. Link Deas had to decide the amount of damages to award, say, Miss Maudie, when Miss Rachel ran over her with a car. Link wouldn't like the thought of losing either lady's business at his store, would he? So he tells Judge Taylor that he can't serve on the jury because he doesn't have anybody to keep store for him while he's gone. So Judge Taylor excuses him. Sometimes he excuses him wrathfully." "What'd make him think either one of 'em'd stop trading with him?" I asked. Jem said, "Miss Rachel would, Miss Maudie wouldn't. But a jury's vote's secret, Atticus." Our father chuckled. "You've many more miles to go, son. A jury's vote's supposed to be secret. Serving on a jury forces a man to make up his mind and declare himself about something. Men don't like to do that. Sometimes it's unpleasant." "Tom's jury sho' made up its mind in a hurry," Jem muttered. Atticus's fingers went to his watchpocket. "No it didn't," he said, more to himself than to us. "That was the one thing that made me think, well, this may be the shadow of a beginning. That jury took a few hours. An inevitable verdict, maybe, but usually it takes 'em just a few minutes. This time-" he broke off and looked at us. "You might like to know that there was one fellow who took considerable wearing down- in the beginning he was rarin' for an outright acquittal." "Who?" Jem was astonished. Atticus's eyes twinkled. "It's not for me to say, but I'll tell you this much. He was one of your Old Sarum friends..." "One of the Cunninghams?" Jem yelped. "One of- I didn't recognize any of 'em... you're jokin'." He looked at Atticus from the corners of his eyes. "One of their connections. On a hunch, I didn't strike him. Just on a hunch. Could've, but I didn't." "Golly Moses," Jem said reverently. "One minute they're tryin' to kill him and the next they're tryin' to turn him loose... I'll never understand those folks as long as I live." Atticus said you just had to know 'em. He said the Cunninghams hadn't taken anything from or off of anybody since they migrated to the New World. He said the other thing about them was, once you earned their respect they were for you tooth and nail. Atticus said he had a feeling, nothing more than a suspicion, that they left the jail that night with considerable respect for the Finches. Then too, he said, it took a thunderbolt plus another Cunningham to make one of them change his mind. "If we'd had two of that crowd, we'd've had a hung jury." Jem said slowly, "You mean you actually put on the jury a man who wanted to kill you the night before? How could you take such a risk, Atticus, how could you?" "When you analyze it, there was little risk. There's no difference between one man who's going to convict and another man who's going to convict, is there? There's a faint difference between a man who's going to convict and a man who's a little disturbed in his mind, isn't there? He was the only uncertainty on the whole list." "What kin was that man to Mr. Walter Cunningham?" I asked. Atticus rose, stretched and yawned. It was not even our bedtime, but we knew he wanted a chance to read his newspaper. He picked it up, folded it, and tapped my head. "Let's see now," he droned to himself. "I've got it. Double first cousin." "How can that be?" "Two sisters married two brothers. That's all I'll tell you- you figure it out." I tortured myself and decided that if I married Jem and Dill had a sister whom he married our children would be double first cousins. "Gee minetti, Jem," I said, when Atticus had gone, "they're funny folks. 'd you hear that, Aunty?" Aunt Alexandra was hooking a rug and not watching us, but she was listening. She sat in her chair with her workbasket beside it, her rug spread across her lap. Why ladies hooked woolen rugs on boiling nights never became clear to me. "I heard it," she said. I remembered the distant disastrous occasion when I rushed to young Walter Cunningham's defense. Now I was glad I'd done it. "Soon's school starts I'm gonna ask Walter home to dinner," I planned, having forgotten my private resolve to beat him up the next time I saw him. "He can stay over sometimes after school, too. Atticus could drive him back to Old Sarum. Maybe he could spend the night with us sometime, okay, Jem?" "We'll see about that," Aunt Alexandra said, a declaration that with her was always a threat, never a promise. Surprised, I turned to her. "Why not, Aunty? They're good folks." She looked at me over her sewing glasses. "Jean Louise, there is no doubt in my mind that they're good folks. But they're not our kind of folks." Jem says, "She means they're yappy, Scout." "What's a yap?" "Aw, tacky. They like fiddlin' and things like that." "Well I do too-" "Don't be silly, Jean Louise," said Aunt Alexandra. "The thing is, you can scrub Walter Cunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but he'll never be like Jem. Besides, there's a drinking streak in that family a mile wide. Finch women aren't interested in that sort of people." "Aun-ty," said Jem, "she ain't nine yet." "She may as well learn it now." Aunt Alexandra had spoken. I was reminded vividly of the last time she had put her foot down. I never knew why. It was when I was absorbed with plans to visit Calpurnia's house- I was curious, interested; I wanted to be her "company," to see how she lived, who her friends were. I might as well have wanted to see the other side of the moon. This time the tactics were different, but Aunt Alexandra's aim was the same. Perhaps this was why she had come to live with us- to help us choose our friends. I would hold her off as long as I could: "If they're good folks, then why can't I be nice to Walter?" "I didn't say not to be nice to him. You should be friendly and polite to him, you should be gracious to everybody, dear. But you don't have to invite him home." "What if he was kin to us, Aunty?" "The fact is that he is not kin to us, but if he were, my answer would be the same." "Aunty," Jem spoke up, "Atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho' can't choose your family, an' they're still kin to you no matter whether you acknowledge 'em or not, and it makes you look right silly when you don't." "That's your father all over again," said Aunt Alexandra, "and I still say that Jean Louise will not invite Walter Cunningham to this house. If he were her double first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he comes to see Atticus on business. Now that is that." She had said Indeed Not, but this time she would give her reasons: "But I want to play with Walter, Aunty, why can't I?" She took off her glasses and stared at me. "I'll tell you why," she said. "Because- he- is- trash, that's why you can't play with him. I'll not have you around him, picking up his habits and learning Lord-knows-what. You're enough of a problem to your father as it is." I don't know what I would have done, but Jem stopped me. He caught me by the shoulders, put his arm around me, and led me sobbing in fury to his bedroom. Atticus heard us and poked his head around the door. "'s all right, sir," Jem said gruffly, "'s not anything." Atticus went away. "Have a chew, Scout." Jem dug into his pocket and extracted a Tootsie Roll. It took a few minutes to work the candy into a comfortable wad inside my jaw. Jem was rearranging the objects on his dresser. His hair stuck up behind and down in front, and I wondered if it would ever look like a man's- maybe if he shaved it off and started over, his hair would grow back neatly in place. His eyebrows were becoming heavier, and I noticed a new slimness about his body. He was growing taller. When he looked around, he must have thought I would start crying again, for he said, "Show you something if you won't tell anybody." I said what. He unbuttoned his shirt, grinning shyly. "Well what?" "Well can't you see it?" "Well no." "Well it's hair." "Where?" "There. Right there." He had been a comfort to me, so I said it looked lovely, but I didn't see anything. "It's real nice, Jem." "Under my arms, too," he said. "Goin' out for football next year. Scout, don't let Aunty aggravate you." It seemed only yesterday that he was telling me not to aggravate Aunty. "You know she's not used to girls," said Jem, "leastways, not girls like you. She's trying to make you a lady. Can't you take up sewin' or somethin'?" "Hell no. She doesn't like me, that's all there is to it, and I don't care. It was her callin' Walter Cunningham trash that got me goin', Jem, not what she said about being a problem to Atticus. We got that all straight one time, I asked him if I was a problem and he said not much of one, at most one that he could always figure out, and not to worry my head a second about botherin' him. Naw, it was Walter- that boy's not trash, Jem. He ain't like the Ewells." Jem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed. He propped himself against a pillow and switched on the reading light. "You know something, Scout? I've got it all figured out, now. I've thought about it a lot lately and I've got it figured out. There's four kinds of folks in the world. There's the ordinary kind like us and the neighbors, there's the kind like the Cunninghams out in the woods, the kind like the Ewells down at the dump, and the Negroes." "What about the Chinese, and the Cajuns down yonder in Baldwin County?" "I mean in Maycomb County. The thing about it is, our kind of folks don't like the Cunninghams, the Cunninghams don't like the Ewells, and the Ewells hate and despise the colored folks." I told Jem if that was so, then why didn't Tom's jury, made up of folks like the Cunninghams, acquit Tom to spite the Ewells?" Jem waved my question away as being infantile. "You know," he said, "I've seen Atticus pat his foot when there's fiddlin' on the radio, and he loves pot liquor better'n any man I ever saw-" "Then that makes us like the Cunninghams," I said. "I can't see why Aunty-" "No, lemme finish- it does, but we're still different somehow. Atticus said one time the reason Aunty's so hipped on the family is because all we've got's background and not a dime to our names." "Well Jem, I don't know- Atticus told me one time that most of this Old Family stuff's foolishness because everybody's family's just as old as everybody else's. I said did that include the colored folks and Englishmen and he said yes." "Background doesn't mean Old Family," said Jem. "I think it's how long your family's been readin' and writin'. Scout, I've studied this real hard and that's the only reason I can think of. Somewhere along when the Finches were in Egypt one of 'em must have learned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy." Jem laughed. "Imagine Aunty being proud her great-grandaddy could read an' write- ladies pick funny things to be proud of." "Well I'm glad he could, or who'da taught Atticus and them, and if Atticus couldn't read, you and me'd be in a fix. I don't think that's what background is, Jem." "Well then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter can hardly sign his name, I've seen him. We've just been readin' and writin' longer'n they have." "No, everybody's gotta learn, nobody's born knowin'. That Walter's as smart as he can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help his daddy. Nothin's wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks." Jem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was cloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came together; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while. "That's what I thought, too," he said at last, "when I was your age. If there's just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I'm beginning to understand something. I think I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time... it's because he wants to stay inside." "

"aaa","Fernando Bazan runs a small business packing parcels in central Mexico City. Usually he gets a steady stream of drop-in customers all day. But for the last four days, revenues have halved. "Not many people want to come into the shop", he says. "They are afraid. They ask us to pick up their packages from their homes". His experience is one of millions in this huge bustling city. A minuscule virus has transformed the capital. What was once one of the noisiest, dirtiest, busiest places in the world, has become strangely sterile - a quiet city, where many people wear masks outdoors, and most don't go out. This mutation is costing a fortune. In Mexico City alone, the mayor, Marcelo Ebrard, has put the figure at $88m (£59m) a day. But how much will swine flu hit the wider Mexican economy? Tourism, which represents 8% of Mexico's gross domestic product (GDP), is the sector which will inevitably be hardest hit. In the current environment, most people see little incentive to visit Mexico, and plenty of reason to leave. The Mexican government has lobbied hard behind the scenes to prevent its borders being closed, or any formal quarantine being imposed. But other governments and airlines are beginning to apply their own restrictions. Job losses Cuba and Argentina have already stopped direct flights to Mexico. France is seeking a formal European ban on flights. The real cost of swine flu depends on how long this crisis lasts. It looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year Damian Fraser UBS UBS bank in Mexico City estimates the crisis could take out 0.2% of annual GDP if it subsides in the next two weeks, or 0.8% of GDP if it goes on for two months. The timing could hardly be worse. Mexico is already in the midst of a complex and disruptive drug war, and is being hit hard by the global recession. Not even taking swine flu into account, Mexico's central bank forecasts a fall in GDP of up to 4.8% this year. "The hope was that the economy would stabilise in the second quarter and then improve, but it looks like swine flu will at best postpone a recovery to the second half of the year'' says Damian Fraser, Latin America equity strategist at UBS. Another concern is how far the swine flu might hit the US economy. Mexico sends 80% of its exports to the United States, and in the event the virus has economic repercussions there, matters will only get worse here. Unemployment could be the most striking consequence. Mexican economist Rogelio Ramires - from consultancy firm Ecanal - believes that a crisis lasting several weeks, together with a prolonged US recession, could result in one in every eight Mexicans losing their jobs. "We are looking at a very dramatic fall", he says. Globalisation has enabled this new virus to be spread around the world with extraordinary speed. Any sharp decline in the Mexican economy will be equally far felt. "

Stating that obesity rates among children are not influenced by the number of fast food restaurants. Funny enough, data released by a university in Alberta, Canada contradicted that data further, stating that the number of fast food restaurants does effect the obesity rate. Ughh.. I'm being run around in circles but what is true at the end of the day is that we have a growing epidemic and our children don't have time to wait on studies. McDonald's needs to stop aggressively advertising to youth and maybe then we'll see a legitimate curb in statistics.

Sadly, the former, specifically the current educational system~~ coupled with the overall Madison Ave brainwashing of our youth as to what is and is not of value~~ is designed to dumb down the population. The latter key, one's gene pool, determines whether or not we allow that to happen. Looks like environment is winning, if your facts are indeed factual.

I got tired of getting emails from people like that so I put in my profile that I was not just there looking for sex - please don't write if you are. They took that out of my profile and wouldn't let me post it. So it's ok for men to post that they want sex but not for women to post that they don't! Pretty discriminatory - and I've told them that, too. One man in particular has age 44 posted on his profile. I could tell from his photographs that he was much older than 44. He had emailed me several times asking when I was going to meet him and finally, I emailed him and asked him how old he really was. His real age was 68. I told him that I thought that was wrong and I was going to report him to Singlesnet. He responded to me with: "When I first joined this dating service more than one year ago, I entered my actual age and received profiles of ladies who were between the ages of 55-65.. After several dates and discussions, I decided to call the Singlesnet organization to see why I was not receiving profiles of younger ladies. The singlesnet people told me that their computer only issues profiles of ladies who are no more than 20 years younger than the person requesting profiles. Since I prefer dating younger ladies between ages 35 -55 I told Singlesnet that I was disatisfied with the profiles of older ladies. She also told me that there was no way that I could go into my account and change my age. She said the thing that she could do so that I would receive profiles of Younger ladies is to "Plug in a number" and that is what she did." So there you have it. You can't search for anyone by entering YOUR preferences, they chose those preferences for you. And if that doesn't work they tell you to lie on your profile. I've emailed Singlesnet about this - it's wrong and I do NOT think that they should be allowed to do this. "
"Criminal Prosecutions referred by Department of Homeland Security Custom and Border Protection in the last three years","We now know about government withholding evidence regarding the prosecution of Senator Ted Stevens. Within the Department of Homeland Security exists the Office of Transportation Security Administration. The general manager of field operations for TSA is Melvin J.

All may read sworn testimony that Carraway gave the Indiana State Police Board while viewing transcripts posted online within a titled work: The Grand Jury: Phase II - I Admonish You1 at www.govexposed.com.

He may not have been great, but it is impossible for him to have been as bad as everybody says. Don't start screaming his vices at me, I've heard them all a million times already. After "new president" scent wears off, everybody will start taking stabs at Obama (it's already started) just like they did at Bush. The problem is not "bad presidents." The problem is that America has lost all faith in it's government, and the president is the highest ranking official in said government. If you really want to gripe about the root of the problem, complain about Congress, the part of the government that actually legislates all of this crap: the president can only check yes or no, and Congress can uncheck the no box if they really want to.

"Boccioni sampler","Speaking at the opening of 'Conclave on India/Africa Project Partnership 2007' in Maputo, Mozambique's Minister of Energy, Salvador Namburete, said Mozambique has become "one of the major African destinations for investment from various parts of the planet." The country is indeed one of Africa's success stories. After a cruel civil war that lasted nearly two decades (1975-1992), the country organised general elections, took a careful approach to the 'structural adjustment' programs introduced by international institutions like the World Bank and the IMF, and, ensuring political and economic stability, steadily attracted foreign investments. The country's GNI has doubled in the past 5 years, and GDP growth was 7.7% last year (World Bank data). Investments not only include mega-projects such as the MOZAL aluminium smelter on the outskirts of Maputo, and the Brazilian investment in coal mining in the western province of Tete, but also a 'concerted effort by the government to promote the country's enormous business potential' to 'non-traditional' investors in Asia, including India. Namburete says the government hopes to see further investment in such areas as agriculture, food processing, mining and energy. Biofuels and poverty alleviation India is seen as a prime partner in the sector of renewable energy because of its growing expertise. We would like to see Indian involvement in the field of renewable sources of energy. India has a very advanced experience in this area, in solar energy and in biofuels. Its technology is good, simple and easy to use, and that's what we need to fight against poverty.- Salvador Namburete, Mozambique's Minister of Energy Namburete will also be present at the EU's high-level meeting on international biofuels trade to be held this Thursday in Brussels, where Mozambique's biofuel potential has been recognized. Biopact was invited to attend this two-day conference and we will be reporting on it from Friday onwards. Namburete insisted that the Mozambican government remains committed to the promotion of biofuels "with the aim of responding to the national poverty alleviation agenda, as well as providing a response to high, unpredictable and volatile oil prices on the world markets". High oil prices are disastrous for developing countries, with some now spending twice as much on importing petroleum than on health. Among the benefits of biofuels the minister mentioned the fact that "they are labour intensive, and can create agricultural and agro-industrial employment, self-employment and income". Producing biofuels does not threaten food security in Mozambique, given its vast unused land base. Estimates (map, click to enlarge) by researchers working for the International Energy Agency put the country's explicitly sustainable biofuel potential at around 6.7 to 7 Exajoules per year, with moderate introduction of agricultural technology and using strict sustainability criteria. 6.7EJ is the equivalent of around 3 million barrels of oil per day (earlier post). Namburete pointed out that Mozambique has 36 million hectares of arable land of which only nine per cent is currently in use: energy :: sustainability :: biomass :: bioenergy :: biofuels :: poverty alleviation :: rural development :: Mozambique :: Furthermore, a crop like Jatropha curcas, can be grown "on an additional 41.2 million hectares of marginal land, giving people in rural areas the opportunity to generate an income out of land that did not produce anything at all". Namburete pointed out that it was not enough that Mozambique had natural resources - the government had to take a pro-active role in attracting investment, though a consistent and coherent programme of reforms to ensure macro-economic stability and efficient management in selected priority areas, such as fiscal management, public sector and financial reforms, improving the investment climate and the ongoing reform of the judicial system. The minister stressed that the government is taking further steps to reduce the cost of doing business in Mozambique through decentralisation, streamlining of licensing procedures, addressing the rigidities in the labour market, and improving basic infrastructure, such as energy, roads and telecommunications. For his part, the Indian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anand Sharma, said that agriculture was vital for India's cooperation with Mozambique and other members of SADC (Southern African Development Communitry). "We want to cooperate with these countries and help Africa advance and improve its investment climate", he said. Besides investors from India, several initiatives from Europe, Brazil and China have been launched in the country's biofuels sector (earlier post). Amongst them is a typical South-North-South exchange which sees Italy and Brazil cooperating on biofuels in Mozambique. "

"Obama's Stimulus Plan — the breakdown","I have read all of the posts regarding the stimulus package. I am happy to say that I see several that show that as Americans we can get through this mess. Does a single person have the correct answer? I think not. As for me, my stimulus package requires additional responsibility, respect, and being retrospective. If we as a people are finacially responsible, respect and help our family, friends, and neighbors and use our the past history to improve our future we will prosper. Will our government be able to make the best decisions for us? Probably not. Will your voice influence your local, state, and federal politician? Possibly. Do I hope that the stimulus package will help myself and America? Yes I do. I do however feel that I am the best person to control my individual economic status. Cadillac, Michigan "

La rotation des collections est égale à : A / B X 100, où : * A est le nombre d'exemplaires prêtés au moins une fois au cours de l'année de l'enquête * B est le nombre total d'exemplaires empruntables dans la collection Rotation des fonds récents : Il s'agit, en pourcentage, du nombre d'exemplaires prêtés au moins une fois parmi ceux acquis au cours des cinq dernières années, divisé par le nombre total d'exemplaires acquis au cours des cinq dernières années et empruntables. NB : les cinq dernières années sont les années n-4 à n (n étant l'année sur laquelle porte l'enquête). Exemple : pour l'enquête 2009 portant sur l'année 2008, sont à considérer les années : 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 La rotation des fonds récents est égale à : A / B X 100, où : * A est le nombre d'exemplaires empruntés au moins une fois, parmi les exemplaires acquis au cours des années n-4 à n * B est le nombre total d'exemplaires acquis au cours des années n-4 à n et empruntables Exemple : la BU a acquis en tout 50000 exemplaires au cours des cinq années considérées. Parmi eux, 35000 peuvent être empruntés par les usagers (B). Parmi ceux-là, 28000 ont effectivement été empruntés au moins une fois (A). La rotation des fonds récents est donc égale à : 28000 / 35000 x 100 = 80% "

"Median age at first marriage, by state","This is good but if you could cut it by education in some way that would be really helpful as education (I feel) is a strong modifier of "median age at first marriage." It could get complicated if you wanted to tease out timing of say bachelor's degree or graduate degree, but just a simple break-out by level of education would provide some insight. For instance, make it able to select "women" + "who completed a graduate degree" - it would be very interesting to compare that age to "women" + "who completed high school only" "
