Abstract (May 2010)—We propose the use of a statistical analysis technique called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for analyzing collaboration between online groups. LSA is a strong method for approximation in natural language processing given large text corpora. The technology has been proven effective in analyzing complex patterns that are part of composite conversations. It is our aim to detect patterns in online collaboration and/or sample email data by capturing several inputs and subjecting them to LSA-enabled programs in MATLAB. Our method of analyzing a large text corpus by the co-occurrence frequency accounts for word usage in several documents while representing their semantic meaning. We show the effectiveness of the collaboration, uncover a few limitations of the technique, and establish basic trends in the context of the overall conversation. Index Terms—LSA, online collaboration semantic analysis, co-occurrence frequency, pattern searching.
