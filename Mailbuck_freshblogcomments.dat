Given up on the Blog Navigator. I went with Pagination using
JavaScript. Until I find a way around it, the only drawback is that you
have to rename the archive files to page1.html, page2.html etc...

Takashi has left a new comment on your post "Blog Navigator: Previous
and Next Post Links":

Hi Greg,

First of all, thank you so much for sharing such a nice script!!! I was
longing for this for ages and am happy to have come across to your site.

As I was installing this onto my blog (URL:
http://www.studiosugi.com/blog), there was something that i couldnt
figure out.... I looked through all the comments and your instruction,
tried the "development" version, but didnt work. so i guess this is
time to ask you a couple of question.

believe me, i tried and tried... and most of the things are working
fine now. but there is still some errors that almost makes me cry...

well, I am using classic template via FTP and my archive method
is "list". of course "daily".

Q1. On the top page, when i click the "more..." link , it just goes to
the top of the page. I think it needs to jump to SECOND previous post
in order to jump to the previous page. How can I do it??

Q2. Whenever I click on Previous/Next links, it jumps to the
Previous/Next page, but the page is displayed from the very bottom, not
from the top... I see "?Nav=bottom" at the end of the html. Is there
anyway I can change it? is this something i have to change in
javascript?? I would rather jump to top of the page.


just in case you need, i will give you the result i got from these
tests;

javascript:alert(archives.join('\n'))

get a chance! I really want this for my blog.

again thank you so much and sorry for long blah blah blah.

take care,

I think it was mentioned before somewhere in the comments, Greg, you
were going to ammend the code to include - if a user clicks on a link
before the page has had chance to load, the code would still work.

Andy W has left a new comment on your post "Blog Navigator: Previous

Hi,

I was wondering if someone could take a look at my blog regarding the
Navigator as I have spent quite a while on this, I am nearly there with
the code and determined to get it working.

My blog URL is http://www.andywhiteley.com/blog

I am using a classic template, on my web host.

When I preview the template in Blogger, before publishing, the code
seems to work.
Yet when I then publish via ftp I get the following error in the
Firefox javaScript error console.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Error: NavLadder is not defined
Source File: http://ghill.customer.netspace.net.au/blog-nav/blog-nav.js
Line: 8
----------------------------------------------------------------------

I am presuming that the code wasn't written for a blog published on an
ftp web host.
Is there any code I can add or change to get this working?

Any help would be appreciated,

Thanks.

[Freshblog] New comment on Blogger Migration for Delicious and FreshTags.
Anonymous has left a new comment on your post "Blogger Migration for
Delicious and FreshTags":

using code #1 (both in Firefox & Safari), not one but THREE windows
popped up for each bookmark in Delicious. After I had consented to
deleting the link on the first of the three, the next two would read:
"Problem deleting item: No such item for deletion. Try to delete this
item again? Yes No"
but from the address bar I could see it was the same item I had just
selected to delete.
this actually made it more time-consuming than using the one at a time
deletion on the Delicious page. I was so hopeful for your code.

Thanks for #1. I imported my bookmarks from the now-defunct Spurl.net
some time ago and needed to clean up a bit (deleting 175+ bookmarks).
With no batch delete function this promised to be a painstaking process
but thanks to your genius script, all is well now.
cheers!

chaging the font size and color for the now clickable post titles. The

woof nanny has left a new comment on your post "Blog Navigator:
Previous and Next Post Links":

I tried this, but I got arrows at each post, when I really want just
arrows and/or an older posts link on the bottom of the page. Clicking
on the links didn't seem to work anyway, and for whatever reason I lost
my banner. Thank God I saved my info, so I was able to recapture it.
Initially I switched from my classic template to a layout, but I hated
that, and went back to classic. It seems adding an older post link
wouldn't be that hard, is it??? I'm so frustrated!

Shoes like:Nike Air Force Ones,Nike Dunks,Dunk Shoes,SB Kicks,Air
Jordan Shoes, Bathing Apes Bapes, Greedy Genius
Shoes,Reebok,Pumas,Adidas,Cheap Nike Shoes.


we prefer to buy a pair of cheap nike Shoes if they'r the same of
brand.we can feel it comfortable what brought
by Air Jordan Shoes,but also relaxing from Jordan Kicks.once u wear
Jordan Shoes,even u think u'r the NO.1,
you'r be more confident than before .i like Jordan Shoes.

Hello! I used the following approach to make it work as categories:
I append at the end of each post a string like [Category: Lifestyle]
or
[Category: General]

And I added a LINKS sidebar and add the links with the querystring of
search of the categories strings that I append at each post.

Here you can see it working:

This medication works to relax those muscles that limit blood flow to
the penile area. This blood flow is vital in gaining and maintaining an

Your link about FeedBurner sends you to a page that no longer exists.
Here is the message you get:

"Important Note: FeedBurner Forums is now a view-only site that no
longer allows new posts. Eventually, the site will be shut down. To

FeedBurner Help Group, part of Google Groups. (Please note that the 3Â½
years' worth of discussion here is now listed â€” and searchable â€” in the

I obviously can find my way, but you could send people to the new "Help

as tends to happen with once-ascendant political tendencies, it had a

conventional wisdom. The netroots shares the neoliberal critique of

[Freshblog] New comment on Blogger Hacks - The Series.
Jae Baeli has left a new comment on your post "Blogger Hacks - The
Series":

I've tried the TOC widget i got online somewhere, and while it worked
very well, it doesn't really solve my problem, and it makes my page
load much slower. I removed it.

Initially, (and still) I wanted to REPLACE the dated blog archive list
with a list of JUST titles. I think the quadruple-nesting is cumbersome
and does not encourage readers to click. (I write blogs frequently).
Isn't there a way to replace the standard blog archive list with a list
of titles, most recent on top? I did this in my previous blog (not
hosted--my own) with just html. I know someone has to know how to do
this, regardless of whether Blogger cares about it.
Thanks for any insight.

Hi Gabriel,

If you want to integrate it into the "new" (getting old now) Blogger,
I'd suggest checking out Singpolyma's implementation. It's designed to
work with Blogger's XML-based code system.

[Freshblog] New comment on FreshTags v. 0.5.
Ngawang Tenphel has left a new comment on your post "FreshTags v. 0.5":

hi, I am trying to set up the freshtags on my blog
www.montanhadourada.org but could not save the codes on to my blogger
account template.

In the build page of freshtags it is said that the first html code
should be put in "head" location of the template. But we have in the
template differents "heads" at the template with different signs before
and at the end of them.
Anyway I tried in both even been not sure wich one should be. In both
it did not work. A message saying "Your template could not be parsed as
it is not well-formed. Please make sure all XML elements are closed
properly.
XML error message: The reference to entity "count" must end with
the ';' delimiter." appeared.
But looking at the code it seems that it is there the delimiter ";!
after the reference "count" line. Strange. So what should be wrong? As
this problem happens right at the beggining I could not even pass the
first step html code.

My other question is about the other html codes. Do they need to be
placed at the template html edit or they can be putted through the "add
elements" page in the option of javascript element?

Thanks for any help
If would be better for you you, you can email me the help to
montanha.dourada@gmail.com
Thanks!
Gabriel

[Freshblog] New comment on FreshTags v. 0.5.
Ngawang Tenphel has left a new comment on your post "FreshTags v. 0.5":

hi, I am trying to set up the freshtags on my blog
www.montanhadourada.org but could not save the codes on to my blogger
account template.

In the build page of freshtags it is said that the first html code
should be put in "head" location of the template. But we have in the
template differents "heads" at the template with different signs before
and at the end of them.
Anyway I tried in both even been not sure wich one should be. In both
it did not work. A message saying "Your template could not be parsed as
it is not well-formed. Please make sure all XML elements are closed
properly.
XML error message: The reference to entity "count" must end with
the ';' delimiter." appeared.
But looking at the code it seems that it is there the delimiter ";!
after the reference "count" line. Strange. So what should be wrong? As

first step html code.

[Freshblog] New comment on Page Title Optimisation - Blogger Hacks, The Serie....
Anonymous has left a new comment on your post "Page Title Optimisation
- Blogger Hacks, The Serie...":

The mathematics of online gambling are always against the individual.
There
is no way that a professional gambler could ever say otherwise and yet
how come
there are people that make money every day playing and gambling online
every
day? Simply, they employ good strategies that work more in their favour
than the
average person. The main goal of the professional gambler is to either
target
weaknesses in online gambling or online casino's or play the other
people off
and win their money. The professional gambler is not bothered by the
winning or
the losing they simply focus on how they can win more and the best
methods to
employ in order to get to their goal. Bet big to recoup loses is a good
method,
a simple and yet effective method which can be employed on the roulette
table by
betting on red or black in roulette. The method is simple, if you lose
then
double up the bet and repeat until you win, then go back to the
original amount
and then repeat until you are winning consistently. Another method on
roulette
is taking a section of the wheel, like betting on a row of numbers next
to each
other. That way if the wheel lands in a region consistently then there
is
greater chance of it being on one of your numbers instead of on random
text.

[Freshblog] New comment on Page Title Optimisation - Blogger Hacks, The Serie....
Anonymous has left a new comment on your post "Page Title Optimisation
- Blogger Hacks, The Serie...":

I simply love Online casino, I play every day and I keep coming back
for more.
I am not a problem gambler because I earn enough money to be able to
support
myself and continue my online gambling time. I truly enjoy the
relaxation time I
get and the ease with which can use and access online casino's. I hate
the
stigma that is associated with gambling online as I view it as a
release, an
escape and real "me" time. If it were to become a problem then I have
no doubt
that I could and would simply cut online casino from my daily
vocabulary. As it
stands though, gambling is simply something I enjoy and the internet
and online
play are just a good way to access casino's. Playing against the house
means I
never have to worry or feel about actually taking money from someone
else as it
is only the online casino that would be paying me off for my wins.
Talking about
wins, I have had some great wins in my online gambling career Ã¢Â€Â“ my
biggest so
far is $5000 on roulette, on one spin. I am fit, happy, healthy and I
love life
and the online casino is just part of my every day existence and escape.

Kuku has left a new comment on your post "Clickable post titles in
blogger...":

Thanks a lot John. I had some trouble with the snippet provided on the
blogger help pages and that absolutely didn't work. I use FTP
publishing and I thought that was the problem. Now its working like a
charm although it has messed up the alink-hover CSS. Somehow a
background color appears upon mouse-over though none of the other links
on the page follows that pattern.At least now I have a permalink for
each post title. Thanks again.--blogs.prashu.com

Blogger made a change to their feeds today. Now, the item.link element
is an array. This broke the Pipe for a few hours before I rectified
it.It works fine now, but if Blogger change it back it will break
again.Naughty Blogger!

baby has left a new comment on your post "Blogger Hacks - The Series":

This is great. I wonder if any of this upsets Blogger.com? I know
Wordpress seems quite happy for you to do whatever you want, but
Blogger.com seems far less open-minded about these sorts of things. To
be honest, I still prefer Wordpress anyway, simply because of it's
functionality and basic style. The WYSIWG editor is better than Blogger
as well, and the site just runs better all round in my opinion.

Johan SundstrÃ¶m has left a new comment on your post "Embiggen Those

I would whole-heartedly recommend the javascript module pattern for
this kind of thing, to avoid leaking out too many global identifiers
outside of your own turf. (You seem to try doing it to some extent
already, but not quite have it down yet.)So steps one and two in your
case would be something like this -- and then
supply "Embiggen.dapperCallback" for Dapper, instead of "procURL". (The
junk on the last line is to keep your current config style, if you want
to remain compatible with it.)

Hey, thanks, Greg, I just enabled Haloscan trackbacks on my blog and I
think I did that correctly.Okay, cool... so I don't have to do anything
at all for the Blogger backlink to show up here eventually. That is
helpful to know.So just the permalink.Have a great night!

Greg has left a new comment on your post "Sidebar Comments and Hearsay":

Hi Christoph,Yes, there's two things going on here. First,
there's "backlinks". These are indexed automatically by Google and
should show up (eventually) if you put a normal hyperlink to this page
on your blog. A "backlink" is just the URL of a page that references
the current page. It's like a inverse-hyperlink, in that sense.The
second thing is a "trackback" - this is a bit more involved and the end
result is something that looks like a comment, except it's the context
on other blogs that mention this page. (Typically, a sentence
beforehand and afterwards, like in search results.)For backlinks, you
don't have to do anything - they'll just show up here in time.For
trackbacks, you'll need to fiddle with some software. Try John's
tutorials linked above for more info.

Hey Greg or ANYONE here who knows the answer, if you could help me that
would be fabulous.I am so lost on how to do something.One, I got this
solution working and it is awesome thanks to you and your personal
help, Greg.The only thing I can't figure out how to do is create a
backlink to this post so that the post I wrote about Hearsay shows up
in the list of Backlinks on your blog.This is really important to me
because I want to send backlinks to several blogs that relate to the
content on mine.I know you click the "Create a Link" text... and then
what?You get a window popping up you can write a post in.Do I have to
use it? Do I have to leave the link field untouched? Or can I just put
a link to this post anywhere? And if so, what link... does it have to
end be
http://blogfresh.blogspot.com/2006/07/sidebar-comments-and-hearsay.html#links
with "#links" at the end or am I way wrong?To say I'm confused and have
no idea how to create a backlink to this post is an understatement.Can
anyone walk me through it?

I have had FreshTags on the back burner for too long. I am attempting
to, once again, add it to blogger beta. Is it possible now? When I try
to put the first chunk of code in the  tag I get a message that
reads:Your template could not be parsed as it is not well-formed.
Please make sure all XML elements are closed properly.XML error
message: The reference to entity "count" must end with the ';'
delimiter.So, I tried adding the semicolon in several locations
after 'count' with no luck. That is as far as I can get. I do miss my
FreshTags.

[Freshblog] New comment on Blog Update Feed and Sidebar Display.
Christoph Dollis has left a new comment on your post "Blog Update Feed
and Sidebar Display":

Yeah, blogKomm seems to work. If you go to http://lovingjacqui.net/
it's up and running and I have recent comments in the sidebar, in this,
PHP powered.The developer, Holger Kreis, recently updated the script
with a much better anti-spam captcha. It allows great styling and all
comments are inline.There are shortcomings with blogKomm though. In
particular, all the comments are stored in one flat .txt file and for a
high volume blog, this just won't cut out; you need databases like
Blogger and Word Press offer.What I really like on both of my blogs'
sidebars is I've fed the recent blog posts, labels, and archives into a
list that creates a flyout menu.Loving Jacqui's flyout menus (including
the one above each post) are HTML 4.01 Transitional, not valid XHTML
1.0 Strict. But ChristophDollis.com's is. So my archives don't take up
a lot of space and yet they all pop out as needed without even needing
to click a drop down list, just hover.Both work great in Win IE 5.5 and
6 (with the .htc Javascript in this case), and without .htc in pretty
much every other browser.It uses PHP to generate a label cloud, which I
transformed into a flyout menu.To get the label cloud PHP, see Where
the Magic Lives. Converting it to whatever HTML outpout is trivial.My
new sidebar favourite, though, is the literal snake graphic when the
comments load. Too cool, and then they pop up.

[Freshblog] New comment on Sidebar Comments and Hearsay.
Greg has left a new comment on your post "Sidebar Comments and Hearsay":

Thanks for the blogkomm link, I've not seen that before.My day job? I
trained as an electrical engineer, worked in corporate IT and now I'm
struggling to write up my PhD thesis in data quality. I also
do "business intelligence" consulting (helping organisations get the
most out of their information).This blog-hacking stuff is one of my
hobbies, as I enjoy coding (and blogging). Started on BBC computers in
1988, if you can believe that.I've had a few jobs, mostly in IT, but
I've never been paid to write a single line of code. I hope to keep it
that way too :-)

Christoph Dollis has left a new comment on your post "Sidebar Comments

That's great, I love it.Thanks a lot, Greg.You helped me put the
finishing touch on it.Also, it updates instantly, like within
30-seconds tops so far, since I use the blogger feed and it seems to
change as soon as it receives a new comment emailed to it.Sweet.I was
expecting every 30-minutes or so which it would have been if I had been
using FeedBurner.I'm sure they'll be some downside to this in the
future like Blogger misordering everything after I update a post, but
you can't have everything. I don't think FeedBurner sorts that out
anyway so no matter.I know many people like WordPress and I probably
would have too had I started with them. Yet I also here of people
having database nightmares.Oh, right, that was TypePad.:-PMy other blog
has BlogKomm comments enabled so I got used to managing the PHP side of
comments.I'll stick with Blogger this time. Hopefully they ONE DAY let
you integrate them into your blog's look and feel, but I'm not holding
my breath.Still, Google gives me Gmail, a custom search engine with
neat hover disappearing watermark graphic effect, FeedBurner, blog
engine... not bad.So are you a software engineer or is your profession
a state secret?

Christoph Dollis has left a new comment on your post "Sidebar Comments

Hey, Greg, that's fantastic, and thank you!It did what I asked it to
do.It looks nice too.I'm curious about the link. Should the link in the
recent comments sidebar go the the exact comment permalink... i.e.,
http://LONGURL#c360950288289487779 or to the top of the comments
section, i.e., http://LONGURL#comments?Mine is going to the top of the
comments.I'm not sure if it's supposed to be.Second, was in Perth for
three months from January to April. Miss Australia dearly and I'm one
of the few people who never had an inkling to visit until I met this
lady.Now Australia has grown on me. Kind of like her.;-)Third, I tried
to create a link to this post like the other people have where they
show up as people who have written about HearSay.It didn't work. How do
I do that?Thanks!

[Freshblog] New comment on Sidebar Comments and Hearsay.
Greg has left a new comment on your post "Sidebar Comments and Hearsay":

G'day Christoph,There's two things going on here. Firstly, Hearsay
isn't parsing your comments properly. This is why the date's buggered
(aside: when you've been in Australia for some months, you'll
appreciate the humour in this sentence.)When you expand the summary
comment, the full comment still has:Christoph Dollis has left a new
comment on your post "Inboxes at Zero (Isn't THAT a Relief!)":That
shouldn't be there.Secondly, you want to drop the date references.1)
Parsing properly. Given that it's worked on many other blogs, this is
weird, and I can only imagine it's due to some bad regular expression
on my behalf. One possibility is that your post title has some
parentheses and exclamation points in there? It doesn't seem to be a
problem on other posts. If it crops up again, send me another note.2)
Dropping date references. To get rid of the tool tip, remove this
line:descr.title=comData.timestamp;To get rid of the time lag in
parentheses, drop this sequence of characters:('+comData.lag+')That
should be it!(I just tested it on your blog by running the modified
code in the browser. Works fine.)Please let me know how you get
on.Cheers,-Greg.

Dear Greg,I'm going to ask for help, but I also want to express my
gratitude for producing such an amazing solution so long ago and
helping people with it as recently as five days ago.As almost all your
commentators have said, this is wonderful and appreciated.Off topic,
but I may actually be an Australian one day.I started "web design"
(such as mine is!) with a Blogger blog for my Perth girlfriend, whom I
met on the internet and have since met in real life. She's everything
I've ever wanted.Ã¢Â€ÂœLoving JacquiÃ¢Â€Â  - if anyone wants to drop "Bear" off a
comment, guaranteed she will be tickled pink.That blog I can't spend
the time to code right now, but I've just written a new business
website (which, except for the things Blogger publishes, is valid XHTML
1.0 Strict and CSS) because I'm looking for a job.It's to help me find
a good one.I put your script (the new version) on it and it looks
great, but I'm getting an error.Instead of the date of the comment
showing up, I'm getting:"(just now)"... and when I hover, the tooltip
error, "Invalid Date".I've been troubleshooting for a long time, but I
don't really know JavaScript and haven't had much luck.I get the error
regardless of whether I use Blogger's or FeedBurner's RSS.The feeds are
located
at:http://c-pgsb.blogspot.com/rss.xmlhttp://feeds.feedburner.com/c-pgsb...
respectively. You can click my name to reach my blog, I just don't want
to put more than three links here for fear of spam filters.I turned off
the FeedBurner SmartFeed feature to make it compatible for all readers
because I want it to stay RSS. I'm forwarding through Gmail and the
publishing part is working without a hitch.Ultimately, I would prefer
not to have the comment dates because I don't anticipate getting a huge
amount them. As I said, my site is really targeted to a very small
market of people who want something sold and want a sales pro to do
it.So I'm wondering if there's any way you could tell me how to remove
the date feature from it?That would be great and would save the effort
of fixing it.Then it would just have this format:Commentator Name on
Blog Post Title:Comment text...Either that, or getting the dates to
work!In a perfect world, and this is going way over and above what I
have a right to expect, it would even be better if just the Commentator
Name was clickable and not the the Blog Post Title.But that's a really
minor thing. Getting rid of the date error and maybe the date field
altogether is my big concern! I can erase the "just now" part, but then
the parenthesis () still show up and I get the JavaScript "Invalid
Date" tooltip error message.So if I just knew how to get rid of the
dates that would work.Can you help?

Hi Rens,Try the following:1) Use the latest version of the script, v01b

call:hearsay("http://www2.blogger.com/feeds/841924008233186766/posts/full/?alt=rss", "recent-comments",
false);(where your blog ID is 841924008233186766)That should do
it!-Greg.

Those tags don't make sense either because the script wouldn't run, but
the thing is, it might be a setting or something, but blogger keeps
closing tags, and adding things in my code. When I put my tag in the
template, and make a post, blogger has already changed the tag, and it
becomes: Which isn't what I even wanted.

OK, I didn't understand your comment about "only the code".Source, is
the JavaScript visible in the page that Blogger is serving up?I'm not
sure why you've got HTML markup (the BRs) inside your script block. I
imagine this would throw errors.Perhaps the best thing to do is look at
examples of embedding scripts into the new templating system. Try our
old friend Singpolyma.

That's weird. I'm afraid I'm not at all knowledgable about Blogger's
current tag/template system. Getting the date of the post shouldn't be
too hard though; it's usually printed above every post.Still, do you
get any JavaScript errors (check console)? When you publish a page with
this code, can you see the function call in the resulting HTML (check
view source)?

Yeah, it's the post template. These instructions are for the "old"
Blogger. The "new" Blogger has different template tags. The basics
should work okay; you'll just need to find out the "new" Blogger
equivalent of that tag is ie the div that's got the actual body of your
post in it.

People who settle for less use tinyurl. It's even blocked in many
countries by many ISPs. I use snipurl, or snipr.com in their new beta.
Not only do they offer several more features for snipped URLs, they
also have APIs that make this elongation of long urls trivial. Check
them out.

[Freshblog] New comment on Blogger Beta Feed URL's.
Darnell Clayton has left a new comment on your post "Blogger Beta Feed
URL's":

Thanks for the feedback. Aditya, I'm glad you found the "demo" - I'm
sure there's a heap of cool things that can be done with slicing and
dicing your own content like this.Singpolyma, it only requires an
anchor named with "update" ie - what you put inside the anchor is up to
you.

the idea of permalinks to updates in the posts... that's really good!

Thanks, Johan. I'll be sure to stamp my passport on the way
out :)Singpolyma, that all sounds good. At the moment, my blog does 1,
3, 4 and 5. (Google on drugs in AFL to see it pick up both the query
and the embedded tag.)Of course, we'd need to employ some stemming on
the tags/queries to ensure we got enough hits.Maybe we could mix it up
with your tag synonym service too?

Somewhat oddly, Blogger has switched its RSS feed back to
using "description" instead of "content" for its field names. This has
been reflected in the script.

[Freshblog] New comment on Sidebar Comments and Hearsay.
Greg has left a new comment on your post "Sidebar Comments and Hearsay":

Hi Fatima,Yes, it's a Blogger 2 thing. I upgraded to the New Blogger
about a week ago and found it broke Hearsay in two ways:* RSS feed
changed its labels from "description" to "content"* The format of the
email being sent has changed.I produced an updated version of Hearsay
that accounts for this. (It works for both the old and new, so you
won't lose your "old" comments.)Try using this script
instead:hearsay-v01b.jsIt's bad and ugly and was not intended for
public consumption as I'm trying to get out of blog hacking and move on
with my life ... :-)Given that New Blogger let's you access your
comments as an XML feed directly, I'm sure there are other, saner ways
of getting recent comments happening. Try the wiki or see what
Singpolyma's up to.

[Freshblog] New comment on Sidebar Comments and Hearsay.
Fatima Ualgasi has left a new comment on your post "Sidebar Comments
and Hearsay":

Hi,I have been trying to implement the hearsay hack on a new team blog
I'm setting up at Blogger: http://versbloed.blogspot.com. I set up a
comments blog at http://versbloed2.blogspot.com and configured the
first one to forward comment notifications through a gmailaddress to
the comments blog. It all seems to work fine. So far so good. I then
put all the code where it should be and alas all i get is the loading
pic like forever...I noticed in one of your advices above that there
could be a language issue (f.e. "commentaires récents"), so i tried
every Dutch translation of "recent comments" I could think of. But i
still get the same script error:line: 9char: 848error: 'HStargNode' is
empty or no objectAnd of course the loading pic :-)Which is already an
improvement. At first I tried it with a feedburner feed address and
that gave me only the empty box some other people mentioned. The
blogger comments feed address seems to work better.For the moment this
blog is only readable for the authors, until its press release,
probably next Monday. Could that be the problem? Or perhaps New Blogger
has something to do with it?I'm at a loss. I would appreciate any
advice, as i would really like to use this hack. I've looked at
examples of it and it's just what i'm looking for, if only i could get
it to function properly :-)

posted after the "head" tag in the new Blogger template gave me an XML
parse error message.Under "General", I left all fields blank since I
don't have a delicious account, and under "default", I typed in "movie
review" (w/o the quotes). When I added the code that was generated in
the template, I got the error message.Would you know if there is some
incompatibility with the new blogger? Or am I doing something
wrong?Will appreciate some help, or if you can point me in the right
direction.Thanks a lot!!-Amit

I haven't been checking this too often ...Angel - I hope you found my
response to your other comment okay. Basically, it repeats Singpolyma's
plug above. Which I heartily endorse.Johan - sounds very interesting.
I've been using a string-and-tape generic mode on my homepage,
converting the delicious RSS feed via Singpolyma's XOXOtools Ning app.
For the past eight months or so you could only pass in one tag at a
time. However, I notice now you can do multiple tags.Pipes thing sounds
like a good way to go - are you planning on supporting tag/user
intersections, unions or both?

anyone would want to play with that; I'm working on a hack for browsing
multiple del.icio.us users' bookmarks at the same time which would also

I hope, going from either the HTML or RSS generic feed.

Has anyone looked into updating this solution to work with the new
Labels feature on blogger.com? Seems like a logical progression,
especially since the blogger.com people havent added this to blogthis
themselves, for some reason...

Just leaving a note for people on the New Blogger (ie, was Blogger

alternate version that does function on the New Blogger.Sort of a plug,
but just in case people are freaking out about it not working :)

Digger, I thought I had seen some evidence of penalization at one time,
but I haven't tested it in quite a while. It could have just been
general t-rati flakiness. I couldn't find any info in the t-rati ToS or

Greg has left a new comment on your post "Fresh FlickrFont From Feeds":

Hey Johan,Yeah, as I understand it the Flickr JSON service will only
give you a callback function called jsonFlickrFeed.Even passing in the
jsoncallback parameter doesn't seem to gain traction. If desperate, you
could try mangling it through Singpolyma's xoxotools.ning.com converter.

Heh; a great utility for practicing writing letters to your foes,
indeed! ;-)Out of curiosity, since you have worked more with the Flickr
APIs than I have -- can you pitch the feed generator another callback
name somehow, as you should with proper JSONP feeds?It seems the Flickr
API has it (but using the query parameter "jsoncallback" instead
of "callback"), but I don't know of anything similar here, and wanted
to try using Flickr as another testcase of Exhibit's generic JSONP
loader code I just checked in.

John, the only thing beta has going for it is the labels, but you lose

keep features that worked and just added to it, but no, that's too
smart! I use to be able to add great banners to my blog easily by
simply uploading them to a post, copying the image links from that
post, then add them to my blogs template, but that doesn't work
anymore! I'm not providing a link to my profile due to the extremely

Hi Patrick,Yes, this is an old post! This morphed into FreshTags, which is still in use by some. However, it was primarily meant to overcome a Blogger limitation (lack of categories) that is now addressed.For FreshTags under new Blogger, check out Singpolyma's implementation. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 1/24/2007 10:01:30 AM

I made the switch a couple of weeks ago, and I really did not want to switch. But since everyone eventually has to, I figure I would leap.I have been impressed with the transition actually. I have a fairly large blog (nearly 400 posts and a lot of comments), and everything seems okay now.You can keep the old template, but I have been transferring to the new layouts it uses. It is a bit different, but I can still do a little html, when needed. --Posted by Leesa to Freshblog at 1/05/2007 01:35:00 PM

I've been nagged by Blogger with these messages for the last month or so.Although from what I've read the Beta looks good it still means a load of fiddling around to get the template to look the same and the fact that when you revert you can't change back means for me personally it's not been top of the 'to do' pile.One day maybe I'll get time to try it out ... --Posted by Geoffrey Coan to Freshblog at 12/16/2006 04:00:54 PM

I'm using Firefox 2.0 with the latest GreaseMonkey and have just downloaded the script. It works nicely, except for one item.If I use the BlogThis! button on my Google toolbar, everything starts out fine. I write my post, fill in tags, and submit the post. It publishes, and all is good. However, the Publish page does not show the "post to del.icio.us" link.If I go to blogger.com and create a post there, the publish page does show the del.icio.us link. Just not when I use BlogThis. Is this normal behavior? Is there a fix? Thanks. --Posted by Scrape to Freshblog at 11/18/2006 02:59:03 PM

Hi Greg,I also wasn't able to get this to work in FF (or IE7, for that matter). I was trying to batch edit to make all my private links public, and I followed the instructions you gave above. What happened was that the script seemed to be working, it ran down the page and looked at each bookmark, but when it got to bookmarks that were private, it simply didn't change them. Incidentally, I also tried your auto-tagger, and it didn't work for me either. Could it be because I'm using FF 2.0? Or is there some setting I should change somewhere? Thanks for a great script, even if it doesn't work for me! :) --Posted by Blaise Astra to Freshblog at 11/09/2006 01:11:51 AM

I should also add that I see no reason (unless you have a long description) not to use the "" tag in the code where you have "Sitename: Site Description" listed. Since you've got the conditional tags surrounding it already, you can make the title of your blog whatever you want on the appropriate settings change and it will be automatically inserted. --Posted by amr to Freshblog at 11/06/2006 02:08:05 AM

Thanks, Greg.  I should have been able to figure that out, but I was excited about this new tool.  The other very cool thing is, this fixed the problem that I was having where technorati was not picking up my updates no matter how much I pinged.  So I'm a happy camper now. --Posted by Laurie to Freshblog at 11/03/2006 10:59:44 AM

To answer one of Greg's questions since I've tried it out. Blogger does indeed publish a separate page for each label. Archives are published as normal.Like you I was surprised that labels made it into FTP support as well. I figured they would keep that blogspot only.A comment on the post..although the buzz article doesn't mention compulsory don't think it won't be (at least at some point). How they will do it is of course unknown, but eventually everyone will be assimilated. And the word on the street is that  really really soon in Bloggerspeak means a timescale based on weeks. But I suppose we shall see. --Posted by phydeaux3 to Freshblog at 11/02/2006 10:05:04 PM

I must admit to being quite surprised that the FTP option is being included. I assumed the ability to display posts by label (and combinations of labels) would blow out of the water this option.Does Blogger publish a page for each label as well as each archive period? How does it combine them?On a related note, Blogger Beta supports bulk labelling of posts - just the thing for retro-fitting tags to your blog. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 11/02/2006 09:40:38 PM

One word : plagarism.I see enough posts from FreshBlog et al on other's blogs (sometimes with, sometimes without credit), which is dumb enough.  A service designed to do this just makes things worse. --Posted by Singpolyma to Freshblog at 10/31/2006 08:52:12 AM

Nope, I don't like it.It fractures the focus with its comment-stealing. Plus, it forces owners (and regulars) to check a mirror site for relevant comments. All to generate more pageviews and ad impressions that benefit no-one except ClipClip.What advantage does this service offer over "traditional" bookmarking (including quoted excerpts)? The only one I can think of is if URLs are not permanent (ie content changes).Outside of this case (ie for nearly all web content), I hope people have the good sense to avoid this service and not expect anyone to read their comments therein.-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 10/31/2006 08:22:51 AM

@singpolyma, greg: Yes, I mean the former.

For #3, if you mean  "Can readers send labels/tags to delicious when they t=
ag my posts?" then Singpolyma is right; those tags will get dropped from a =
"post to delicious" URL like this:http://del.icio.us/post?url=3Dh=
ttp://myblog.com&title=3DAnother%20Post&tags=3Dtag1+tag2+tag3If t=
he reader is logged out of delicious, they will be prompted to login and th=
e tags info will be dropped.But, if they are logged in (with eg u=
sername "me"), then they can do this:http://del.icio.us/me=
?url=3Dhttp://myblog.com&title=3DAnother%20Post&tags=3Dtag1+tag2+tag3and the tags will be preserved.Of course, you can't anticipat=
e what your readers' usernames will be, so maybe a link like this is the an=
swer:javascript: du=3Dprompt('Please enter delicious username:=
'); window.location.href =3D "http://del.icio.us/" + du + "?url=3Dhttp://my=
blog.com&title=3DAnother%20Post&tags=3Dtag1+tag2+tag3"NB: You=
'd have to put in the appropriate URL, title and tags based on Blogger temp=
late tags or similar.-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 10/18/2006 11:0=

#3 -- if you want to see functionality similar to the GM script, that will be coming soon.  If you want a link from the footer for users, however, that prefills the tags field, that is known to be impossible (del.icio.us won't let you on purpose).#4 -- the technique is the same as that for Blogger Classic.  Pull off the header info generated by the all-head-content tag, sub it in where that tag is and delete the tag, manually add &lt;link&gt; tags for Feedburner. --Posted by Singpolyma to Freshblog at 10/18/2006 07:06:46 PM

Yes, that bug has been reported as fixed. I have also tested it. See Testing non-beta blogger commenting on beta blog and vice versa, but read the COMMENTS. Also, read a few posts complaining that they couldn't comment after it was reported fixed at the Google Blogger Help forum. And a reader emailed me regarding something in my blog when he tried to comment, but couldn't, and that was also after it was reported as fixed. --Posted by Peter to Freshblog at 10/17/2006 09:30:56 AM

Well I guess I must count as one of the lurkers because I subscribe to the =
RSS feed on my desktop machine. Most of the time I tend to use my laptop so=
 the articles accumulate until I get time to read them (hmmm, 120 unread Fr=
eshblog articles right now so I've a bit to go!).To get around th=
is I tend to get the ones I read more often sent as feedblitz emails (per y=
our other thread & why do people choose to receive RSS via email) - most of=
 the time email works just fine for casual blog reading.One sugge=
stion I would make is that it's quite hard to comment when reading the RSS =
feed.  There's no 'comment on this' button by default so it requires a trip=
 via the original article before you can post anything.  Must be possible t=

I've been getting Freshblog using Rmail for a few months. I'll admit my ignorance: I don't understand RSS. I have tried to set up a few RSS feeds - sending them places like my google home page or my yahoo home page. I'm not sure if it didn't work of if I just didn't bother to look at it.  I don't use an RSS Reader (I'm not even sure what exactly they are). I use Yahoo! webmail. I don't use any filters. I'm not on new Yahoo Beta Email because it hasn't worked on my Firefox browser. And finally, the placement of your email signup did help me choose that option. I don't think I get other blogs by email...so I am open to new options (like RSS). --Posted by Dale Danley to Freshblog at 10/13/2006 07:45:51 PM

Efendi,As you see on Freshblog, we use both Trackback & Backlinks=
. I explain the difference in the post above as follows:"Google b=
acklinks is a useful tool that reformats Google's inbound-link search resul=
ts, displays them in your post footer, and shows you the inbounds to that s=
pecific post. However, it doesn't allow a user to choose to ping your post,=
 and doesn't allow you to ping a post that inspired you.... Trackback allow=
s readers to choose to make a connection, and to choose the extract of thei=
r post that will get the job done, independent of whether a given search en=
gine can see the link."Trackback lets readers make a connection, =
and (at least in my mind) has more value than a backlink because it indicat=
es a conscious choice to ping etc. If you have the choice, I would use both=
. I can't promise they'll both work in blogger beta, but I can't think of a=
 good reason why they won't!I wouldn't drop one in preference for=

Love this script!!!  Took me a few minutes to realize that it wouldn't work in Firefox (or at least I couldn't get it to work), but it works perfectly in IE.  Yippie!!!  No spending forever editing tags.  I do agree with another person on changing the syntax/capitalization/etc.  But, hey, at least we can do some bulk editing.  It's a shame that delicious couldn't come up with something themselves.  Not to mention the annoying issue of making every import automatically private.  Argh. --Posted by Angela to Freshblog at 10/12/2006 04:00:40 AM

"not to cause offence to lurkers (though I doubt any read the comments)"One thing that also at least causes comments to be read (besides coCo) is per-post comment feeds integrated into the reader (not supported on many readers, but it works on mine :D).  This is something Blogger BETA will help us towards, and I'll probably eventually do a tips post to help people with the integration part. --Posted by Singpolyma to Freshblog at 10/11/2006 04:08:19 PM

Crikey!We just dropped about 250 subscribers in one day, according to FeedBurner.

In terms of full versus partial feeds and encouraging participation, the ar=
mchair economist in me poses the following trade-off:How many =
pageviews would you sacrifice to get one comment?Or, a relate=
d question:How many lurkers would you sacrifice to get one act=
ive participant?I think this answer varies from blog to blog.=
 Advertising-driven ones are presumably more interested in clickthroughs, s=
o comments are comparatively "cheap". The same could be said for proselytis=
ing blogs. Self-hosted blogs (where bandwidth charges mean the marginal cos=
t per page served is not zero) would face a different trade-off.H=
owever, the vast majority of blogs receive no (substantial) advertising rev=
enues, and bear no (substantial) costs - it's all about attention.For my money, and not to cause offence to lurkers (though I doubt any read=
 the comments), I'd swap hundreds of lurkers for one Singpolyma - and still=
 come out smiling. Others may rather chase that five figure FeedBurner coun=
t or the three digit Technorati ranking.While all attention is go=
od, I reckon interactive attention (feedback) is the best kind. --Posted by Greg to =

something to think about: if everything you write is available in a feed reader, what is the incentive for lurkers to come to the blog and comment? but, if the blog provides some useful service (such as hacks) that the readers spend time to play with and succeed/fail, they are more likely to give some feedback. --Posted by Anonymous to Freshblog at 10/10/2006 05:26:20 PM

I'm curious about anonymity in this context. I lurk some places because I can... No (easily accessible / instantly obvious) footprints left behind. My profile is semi-anonymous (borderline crap!) & there's only a limited amount of "me" making it out through my fingertips and onto the screen.What if we all had to contribute a little more "me"? Could we attach some signals / content to profiles that would present us with a richer picture of one another? Could we also flag blogs that are "lurker friendly" (not psychotic about the boundaries of the niche)? I'm not going to kick anyone out of here, for instance... (well, except maybe that spam commenter who keeps linking to Fox News stories... What's up with that?) --Posted by John to Freshblog at 10/10/2006 05:18:26 PM

Thanks, John. (For the record, a different John to the author here.) It's a good point - people lurk on some blogs, but not on others. I lurk on about 20 blogs related to economics - I'm interested in the area but don't know enough to participate because I feel I wouldn't meet the "contribution threshold".Well, dammit, questions are contributions too! So I'm going to swallow my own medicine and ask some on these eco blogs. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 10/09/2006 09:31:28 PM

Yes, I thought so. Sorry about that. On the post pages, however, the "next"=
 and "prev" links now work. And nope, I don't already have the bu=

to beta to get them. And I'm too lazy to try to find and rebuild all my pri=
or tweaks for the revised template. Besides, I have a natural ske=

Nielsen identifies the problem well; I know that I have many more visitors than contributors. The balance is sort of like a 99% to 1% ratio in any given day. I think that the problem is inherent in the way the web is structured. There are many different sites on many different topics; I may feel expert (or knowledgeable enough to comment) on some sites, but not so much on others. E.g., while I comment frequently on sites in my niche (birding), I lurk and barely comment on the political sites and tech sites where I lurk. His example of Wikipedia is a good example - some people go to share knowledge, but most go to learn. I did not find Nielsen's suggestions that helpful. They make work for some sites with particular modules installed, but not for most. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 10/09/2006 02:05:10 PM

Hi Anon,Looks to me as though this is hand-coded each time, perha=
ps using Blogger's Post Template feature. The necessary code (from the template you=
 refer to is:&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body&quot;&gt; &=
lt;div&gt;      &lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt=
;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://thedailyexposure.blogspot.com/2006/08/hung-up.ht=
ml&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=3D&quot;http://static.flickr.com/87/229568981_efa88=
4d093_o.jpg&quot; alt=3D&quot;click for previous post&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&l=
t;br /&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Nikon D200 @ 80mm, 1/80 sec, f/6.3, ISO 125&lt;/h1&gt;&=
lt;br /&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://thedailyexposure.blogspot.co=
m/2006/08/hung-up.html&quot;&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt; &Acirc;&middot; &lt;a hr=
ef=3D&quot;http://thedailyexposure.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Current&lt;/a&gt; =
&Acirc;&middot; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://thedailyexposure.blogspot.com&quo=
t;&gt;Next&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;br /&gt;& since it is within t=
he post body div, it appears that it is manually added to each post & that =
the URL's are cut & pasted each time, w/ the "next" on the 2nd most recent =
post being updated to reflect the URL of the most recent post, if that make=
s sense? There may be a way to automate this, but my guess is that it is do=
ne manually....For alternatives, see Johan's method (above), or =
Blog Navigator, or wait for your chance to switch to Blogger Beta, which has these=
 links as standard. John's method, though, is neat, clean & good =
looking. Thanks for the heads-up. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 10/09/2006 10:26:02 AM

Hi-I made a mistake replacing the url last time. So I replaced the line as you said in the last comment and pop up boxes with strings of code in them opened when I loaded the page. I hope that's not too vague. However, the tweak still didn't work at the lowest and highest arrows.And when I put in "javascript: alert(NavLadder)" as you also suggested, it said "?Nav=top," followed by a long string of numbers.I hope that made sense.Best,rational ahmand --Posted by rational ahmand to Freshblog at 10/05/2006 10:56:03 PM

Hi guys,Sorry for delay, I hope this helps.@rational=

ildArchives()":var archives =3D new Array();and =
placing it just before the line:function buildArchives()(ie move archives array definition outside of the function.)the weirdo stalker: I'm not sure what's going on, since I can't r=
eplicate your problems. It could be that the implementation isn't working f=
or you since the script only triggers once the page load event happens. If =
you have a very heavy page, then users will start interacting with it befor=

There is plenty of overlap, but when it comes to long-term traffic generation, link building, and high search engine rankings, Del.icio.us columns are probably a better choice. --Posted by Ed Kohler to Freshblog at 9/29/2006 03:48:15 PM

How do we tie this thing together more tightly?By churning out cotent =

suck.There is a need to help each other out.I dont think people are looking=
 for rewards.How might we encourage or achieve greater "vertical"=

o-peer microsphere formation?I think some platform like wikipedia wher=

I thought I'd scatter some random thoughts around this area ...Ri=
chard, I like this go-meme concept, and related "extended hat-tipping" idea=
s. I wonder if there isn't some scope for tools to help with this, perhaps =
based on keyword highlighting, Dapper, tags and the l=
ike? Perhaps something to help publishers build the recursive structure, or=
 even readers to help navigate it?John, I agree wholeheartedly th=
at audience interest/skill/competence is an important part of successful bl=
ogging, and that trying to appeal to all is doomed to fail. A countering vi=
ew is that, as an avid blog reader, I don't think it's necessary for 100% o=
f posts to be relevant to me for a particular subscription to be warranted.=
 I also think that people's interests/skills/competence will grow over time=
 and that not challenging or providing audience "headroom" means that you'l=
l only ever hang on to readers fleetingly; they'll simply outgrow you too q=
uickly to build a community.An old (?) idea from the early days o=
f the web (pre-Y2K!) was hubs versus authorities:"Some pages, the most prominent sources of primary content, are =
the  authorities on the topic; other pages, equally intrinsic to the struct=
ure, assemble high-quality guides and resource lists that act as focused  h=
ubs, directing users to recommended authorities."While origin=
ally useful, I think this has broken down somewhat, especially in the blog-=
enthusiast scene. For example, you could make a case that our mic=
rosphere has various types strung out along a spectrum from "hub" to "autho=
rity": "hack collators", "hack reviewers", "hack explainers", "hack enhance=
rs" and "hack originators". These different content types can appear within=
 the same blog, with the particular mix drifting over time too. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 9/28/2006 03:49:45 AM

Less tech-oriented communities are less likely than you guys to use tags and such. But I think "carnivals" can play a positive role in reinforcing links (excuse the pun) within blog communities.On the question of incentives for inclusion, do you think go-memes could help? They can generate some pretty impressive linkage, which provides incentives for people to participate in them. And especially if you start a go-meme that's topical for your community, I can see that potentially having some positive community-building effects. --Posted by Richard to Freshblog at 9/26/2006 10:58:48 AM

Jubinell,You would only select multiple tags if there is an "anchor" tag that you want to apply to all of your posts (your blog name, or del.icio.us username, or something...) Otherwise simply choose the "top level" of your del.icio.us account. http://del.icio.us/username/Hope this helps. Let me know if not! --Posted by John to Freshblog at 9/25/2006 12:49:00 PM

Hi Jubinell,You can use CSS to style FreshTags elements, since they all have a class associated with them automatically.For example, the select box that lists out your tags is of class "showtag". You just need to add a rule to your stylesheet that applies to elements of that class.-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 9/25/2006 01:41:01 AM

Thanks for the suggestions, Singpolyma. I've updated the code to drop the l=
aunching stuff - no reason it can't go in the external script.WidgetData is definitely the way to go, especially with the =
namespace issues I've been having (callback functions, onload events, varia=
ble names all stepping on each other's toes).Not to mention the r=
epitition and redundancy in structure and code. This is my fourth or fifth =
hack in the vein of "grab stuff as RSS, run in it through the XOXO converte=
r to get JSON (with callback) and format the results in the sidebar". And t=
hat's not counting FreshTags and related stuff.I try to use the D=
OM "properly" (ie createElement, appendChild) where possible, but the lack =
of a standard for adding event listners means here I reverted to the old ge=
nerate-HTML, insert-into-innerHTML trick.Hopefully =
WidgetData (and a good lightweight event library) will provide the basi=
s to generalise all this stuff to make the inevitable Blogger Beta upgrade =
enticing, rather than foreboding.Maybe then I'll get around to kn=
ocking together a Blogger Beta how-to for these hacks, with the goal of an =
"instant sidebar" that people can just drop on to their blog! -=

A Blogger-BETA set of instructions for this would be cool ;)  And what about using WidgetData, since I've written my post on it now?http://singpolyma-tech.blogspot.com/2006/09/widgetdata.htmlI think it fits this hack perfectly!Also, if you put the load-external-js line after the rest of it, more of that code could be included at the beginning of the external (less template mess!) such as the launchURL and even the addLoadEvent line.Odd that you would request people add the addLoadEvent themselves instead of just including it in the external fine (which makes it slightly bigger, but easier for n00bz).I vote that the market should be something Blogger-BETA related... --Posted by Singpolyma to Freshblog at 9/21/2006 08:58:47 AM

Some has replaced the Blog Header with a graphic by first removing the Header Element, then using "Add a Page Element" to add in a graphic to replace the header. But this has implications on search engine ranking as it removes the Blogger tag $BlogPageTitle$. I have done it another way. I have kept the Header, but added an extra "Add a Page Element" to the Header, and used that to add a graphic to the header. The result can be seen here:Guide to Malaysia. The method to do it is described here:Adding graphic to your blog header. In this way, it leaves the blog search engine friendly. --Posted by Peter to Freshblog at 9/15/2006 02:54:34 AM

@Greg@JohnThanks for your replyes, one of the reasons i aske=
d wether the script could be fixed or not was because the comments feed for=
 migrated blogs isnt working.the 2nd reason is that the "display"=
 looks better than the widget feed thing, the loading animation and the loa=
ding message give it a more KIND OF "hi tech look".with blogger h=
aving comments widget built in, you=C2=B4ll probably not update the script =
anymore but if you did i would certainly use it. --Posted by ricardo.santos to Freshblog at 9/=

Ricardo,I'm not clear as to whether the whole comment feed is broken, or just the display of the URL on the page? To try to roll your own widget, take your blog's comment feed URL, & generate a feed widget with it. See instructions here. The feed url is supposed to show on the page, but this is currently broken for blogs that have migrated. I don't know whether the URL display is broken, or the whole feed is broken? Either way, worth trying the widget. I'm sure they'll fix it asap. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 9/05/2006 10:23:33 AM

Hey Ricardo,That'd be me!Hearsay has some logic in it to extract post details from a forwarded email. I guess this could be stripped out, leaving a simpler script that displays comments in your sidebar. (To answer your specific question: yes, anyone can modify the script. It's released under Creative Commons.)I haven't played with my own Beta blog yet, so can I ask:1) Doesn't Blogger Beta have support for comment feeds already?2) Doesn't it have built-in widgets for rendering a RSS feed in the sidebar?I guess if there's some reason to make Hearsay work with the new platform, I could look at upgrading. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 9/04/2006 09:55:24 PM

hi everyone.i used to use the "hearsay" script to display recent comments on blogger classic, it does still work on beta but the display has changed, tried to find the author from the Url in the script and i get a page that i think its from one of the members of this blog.My question is can anyone modify the script to work/display correctly with beta? since blogs that have migrated dont have recent comments feed this would be a great hack. --Posted by ricardo to Freshblog at 9/03/2006 05:51:15 AM

One discovery I made is that if you remove the:&lt;b:section class='footer' id='footer'/&gt;code, the template stops working.  I am having huge trouble finding out how to get certain data with the new tag strcture (blog id and feed URL, specifically), but am slowly making progress towards translating my Singpolyma Templates into the new widget-compatible code.  If I am successful, this will mean they can be used on Blogger BETA and that people will be able to change the colours and rearrange widgets using the new editor :)  It will also fully ground me in the new template tags system, and force me to translate most of my old hacks (my two comment forms not least among them). --Posted by Singpolyma to Freshblog at 8/31/2006 07:40:19 PM

What if the chart was clickable, to show the titles and teasers for the 5 most recent posts within each slice o' the tag-pie? (in the same window, of course ;-) Is this also an argument for 2-tier tags, or for the pie to only pick up your 10 most frequently / recently used tags? That way the chart reflects the bulk of the content (more like categories) & the extraneous tags that are there for searches get ignored...Should the web allow for rel="maintag" (or similar) as well as rel="tag"? --Posted by John to Freshblog at 8/27/2006 03:09:20 PM

You might like to try playing a bit with an earlier SVG pie=

, and while a bit geared towards showing browser statistics, you shouldn't =

It makes perfect sense for mutually exclusive tags a k a categories (at lea=
st I think that's the more-or-less consensus about "categories" semantics o=
n the web). It is more or less doable client side too if you use coming sta=
ndards like SVG, or Canvas. With a bit of luck we'll see either or both in =
IE7, I'm hoping, so it's for the commons too. --Posted by Johan Sundstr=C3=B6m to Freshblog at=

Greg,Love this idea! I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about "better ways to belong" in the blogosphere, & being able to "find & replace" on a more popular but synonymous tag would bring some consistency, as well as raising the profile of your content & opening it up to more people. Very cool... --Posted by John to Freshblog at 8/23/2006 09:43:54 AM

Just had a thought for extensions to this - what about pulling in tag synon=
yms from Singpolyma's Tagging service?It would=
 be nice if you could indicate a heirarchy, so that a tag could get "p=
romoted" to a more useful (=3Dpopular) variant. Eg "web-2.0" is detected an=
d replaced with "web2.0". Combined with the aut=
o-taggging suggestor and you'd have neat way to populate and tidy your =
tags.Since JavaScript 1.5+ supports using functions =
as the replacement value, it should be fairly low-impact to make such e=
xtensions. --Posted by Greg=

John, The Blog comment feed URL http://beta.blogger.com/feeds/blogID#/comments/fulldoesn't work for migrated blogs (page doesn't seem to exist). It works only for newly created blogs in Beta. That's why I couldn't get the recent comments method working in Hackosphere after migration. --Posted by Ramani to Freshblog at 8/22/2006 01:23:47 PM

Oh yeah - as explained in the instructions, you'll need to set enable your account for private bookmarking. This puts a little "do not share" checkbox on your page, which my script uses to set your bookmarking option (public or private).Alternatively, you can try an earlier single-purpose hack that is less sophisticated. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 8/22/2006 10:45:50 AM

btw, one big problem after google switched to Google Accounts for blogger -=
 I receive blog comments in email at a particular email address (user1@gmai=
l.com) and my blogger user name (user2) is different from that email userna=
me. In fact, my blogger user name happens to be coincidentally a separate b=
logger email (user2@gmail.com) that I had created way back when! =
So now, whenever I have comments to moderate and I try to publish them from=
 my gmail account, blogger automaticaly signs me in as user1 google account=
 and of course I don't have a blog in that name so I have so say sign in wi=
th a different user name and then sign in with user2. But meanwhi=
le, because I signed off from user1, when I get back to my gmail, I have be=
en signed off! $#$^%^!!!! --Posted by RPM to Freshblog at 8/22/2006 1=

Caoline Natasha,All you need is the feed URL for your comments. It'll look like thishttp://beta.blogger.com/feeds/[really long number]/comments/fullA simple way to find the [really long number] part is to go to the bottom of your blog's front page and right click on the "Subscribe to Posts (Atom)" link and copy the link location. Paste that into a text editor and you'll see your blog's long number.In Beta, you can add a feed in the layout with one of the selctable widgets. Add that widget, and when it asks for a URL, put in the one described above. That's all!There may be a more elegant way, but this one's guaranteed for "simpletons". --Posted by Scott to Freshblog at 8/21/2006 10:19:34 AM

As they have it, "Users who have not switched to Blogger in beta will not be able to login to comment on blogs that have been switched.

IMHO wikis should not delete content. Content should be updated with links to what makes them obsolete. One of the big advantages I see with wikis is the maintenance of history.

@john: I am disappointed and surprised that you have not heard of the .net framework. I will let you look at the wikipedia writeup about it  here. It is, like brent says, an environment to run .net apps, much like the JRE. How is everyone ok downloading the latest version of JRE from sun but not the .net framework from Microsoft? In any case, I think .net 1.0 ships with XP (or at least XP Pro/SP2), so you should have a version of it and if you do your Windows updates regularly and include the non-critical updates too, you should have 2.0 also applied. Go to Add/Remove programs and see if you have it listed under there. --Posted by RPM to Freshblog at 8/18/2006 10:19:52 AM

josi, I did the same thing. I didn't realize that it would be so tightly connected to the gmail account. Now I have to do a lot of logging in and out of accounts to get where I need to be (not to mention disabling greasemonkey now and then in the process). I would like to change the log-in gmail account to attach to my blog, but like you, it isn't changable. So, if you are ever able to change the account login, let me know! --Posted by anniebluesky to Freshblog at 8/18/2006 09:47:00 AM

You are kidding right? You have seriously never heard of .Net?The=
 framework is much like how you would need to install the Java machine to r=
un java apps..Net has been around for a few years man. Where have=
 you been? Many Microsoft products run on .Net, and I believe that in the f=
uture, most all will. Microsoft has adapted all of it's coding languages to=
 be compatible with this .Net language.Get with the program dude!=
 Just kidding. .Net won't hurt you. It is intended to be on a Win=
dows box. I am surprised that it is not included as a service pack or somet=
hing by now. Anyway, if you are worried about installing a framework made b=
y Microsoft, in order to run a Microsoft app, then you might want to consid=
er not using Microsoft at all. I recommend Ubuntu. --Posted by Brent to Freshblog at 8/18/2006 03:46:24 AM

Hi Annie,Freshblog's problem is to do with a change in delicious,=
 and we've logged a support query (which is many days old ...). If it's aff=
ecting anyone else, please let us know.Your problem arises becaus=
e Blogger Beta and FreshTags do not get along.FreshTags works by =
putting a "tags" parameter in the URL: http://blah.com/page?tags=3DblueThis is fine for any static page, and you get to put whatever =
you want after the ? without hassle.Now that Blogger has gone dyn=
amic, it's "taken over" that part of the URL. Even appending ?a will break =
the page:http://bloggeruniversit=
y.blogspot.com/2006/08/i-did-blogger-beta-switch.html?aThe upshot is that the hackability of Blogger has been set back.=
On the plus side, it appears to be more flexible for beta blogs with labels=
 (and hence layouts) enabled:http://freshblogbeta.blogspo=
t.com/search?label=3DblahWe'll be looking at FreshTags in lig=
ht of Blogger's upgrade. In the mean time, my advice when upgrading is not =
to expect any hacks to work. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 8/17/2006 11:35:06 PM=

...or spend the vast majority of your time working on Linux/UNIX-based servers.  Or coding by hand.  Or...the list goes on. I don't know what counts as "cool software," but I can name an entire interactive media and software application development company that has existed quite nicely without .NET ever touching one of its machines: my company.In other words, it is not out of the realm of possibility for a significant number of working professionals not only never need to install .NET, but in fact make the conscious and informed choice _not_ to install it.If you have .NET and love it to death, that's great.  Not everyone does. --Posted by JM to Freshblog at 8/17/2006 09:38:47 PM

Hi Christian,That's to be expected since they changed the format =
of the comment notification emails.Hearsay should still prove useful for displayin=
g recent comments, although comment feeds mean=
 it would no longer require the convoluted process of setting up a comments=
 blog and playing around with email forwarding etc.The new Hearsa=
y should just take your blog's comment feed by default and render it nicely=
. Of course, Blogger may come up with even nicer comment display functional=
ity - here's hoping! --Post=

This makes me wonder ... what about endorsements? Does putting tiny choice quotes (not necessarily from "big names") near links help? Would you be more inclined to follow/share a link to some content that had (verifiable) praise attached? This feedback could be mined from the post's own comments, discovered via trackback or gleaned from (unsolicited) emails etc.I'm thinking not just "As seen on ...", but more "Hey, this post really helped me turn my life around" or "This answered questions I didn't even know to ask" - that sort of thing.What do you think? --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 8/17/2006 10:41:53 AM

John, I did what I could to Greasemonkey by adding the new beta addresses w=
hich worked for some of my scripts. Like the one to make my template editor=
 page larger. About the tags. I can see the tag field (after addi=
ng the address  in Greasemonkey) and I am able to add tags to that field. B=
ut 2 things are not happening after that.1. when I publish the post, i=
t doesn't offer the del.icio.us link to go to their site and save (not such=
 a big deal...I can just go and add the link and save it myself, just more =
time involved)2. Even after saving the tags in del.icio.us the tags do=
 not show up on my post on my blog. This is the part I would like to fix.Another thing (isn't there always?)...I use to have the ability  to=
 delete comments if I choose. Is that a feature only with comment moderatio=
n? Not done yet... my google page rank is back to 0. Is there a w=
ay to make them see me again, or do I just have to wait for them to get aro=
und to it?There. I'm done...for now. --Posted by anniebluesky to Freshblog at 8/=

Annie,Do you use the greasemonkey script to add the tags, as well as to bookmark?Can you see the field that you'd usually use to add the tags? Can you add them but just not see them, or are they not even adding? I'm not the king o' the greasemonkey (but I know a man who is!) My guess is that because the beta pages are sitting on different servers & have different addresses, the script isn't set to see those pages and so doesn't run. We might be able to use tools > manage user scripts to "add included pages" (the blogger beta create post page, for instance..) I can't promise that will work, though.... --Posted by John to Freshblog at 8/17/2006 08:31:42 AM

I can't get my tags to show at the bottom of my post.

I'm not ready to transfer over my FTP-served, highly customized blog yet, b=
ut I did set up a test blog to poke around a bit.Without the html=
 editing, there are some really annoying issues that I couldn't get around.=
For example, all of the templates make the title of your post int=
o a permanent link to that post. I'd prefer to use the "link" field there. =
In fact, I couldn't find any templates or any settings that would let the "=
link" field appear on the blog ... anywhere.I put a list in the s=
idebar, but the default in the template was not to put any bullets in front=
 of list items. No way that I can see to change that for now. It's function=
al, but ugly.Also, just for grins I tried adding Google AdWords c=
ode in a widget and it won't appear. I'm not sure if that's a AdWords thing=
 or a not-supporting-scripts-yet thing.There's a lot of good stuf=
f, though. The feed support is very simple and the drag-and-drop widgets sh=
ould make the blogosphere less uniform as newbies play with the options.Here's my=
 test blog. --Posted by=

Greg, you seem to have played with labels already! But, where is the equivalent of the good old Blogger tags for Item title, Item body, permalink URL etc? I browsed through the gdata API which seems to be only for client apps. We need hooks for the template hacks!

Yes, good find!There's some reading on how Atom deals with categories (or labels), and how to =
suck them out of Google.At least there's hop=
e for delicious/Blogger integrating to the point that it should be possible=
 to batch load tags/labels out of delicious and into Blogger ....=
.. or should that be the other way around?At the moment, deliciou=
s has superior tag management facilities - which speaks poorly of Blogger g=
iven my difficulties last week.Where is the natural home for your blog's tags? With your blogging platf=
orm or your tagging platform? --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 8/16/2006 02:00:24 AM

Answering some template questions:If you migrate your blog, your =
template will be preserved as-is. It's in what we call "Classic" template m=
ode. It will be dynamically served, but you won't get the drag-and-drop cus=
tomization. You also won't get labels.New blogs have Layouts by d=
efault, but can switch to Classic mode (there's a button on the Edit HTML s=
ubtab page).You will be able to upgrade from Classic to Layouts, =
but, as the Layouts template language is completely different (but signific=
antly improved), you'll lose your prodigious customizations. We make a best=
 effort to save straightforward changes (sidebar lists, for the most part) =
but your milege will decrease the further you have gone from the stock temp=
lates.You can see that there's a "View Classic Template" button o=
n the Edit page, which is there to make it easier to copy over anything tha=
t the upgrade missed. (I'm going to a have a fun time w/ my blog... might j=
ust take the opportunity to design a new one.)I'm excited to see =
what folks will come up with when Layouts's Edit HTML is available. Draggin=
g and dropping in the official templates is fun, but doing it with your own=
 template design is even better.Oh, and as for mass-lab=
eling, there's no interface for that. You can, however, use the new Gdata =
API (based on Atom 1.0) support to change labels. Atom categories =3D=
=3D=3D Blogger labels. --Po=

@Annie: I'm sure that most of the basic migration stuff will happen without=
 requiring a big change. I can't see all users being required to choose a n=
ew template, for instance.The HTML template editor is there, it j=
ust isn't active. I'm sure it will come online soon.I'm sure the =
URL's will stay the same. Bloggers would be v. upset to lose existing inbou=
nd link-love. The one potential block that I see / issue that I w=
ant to investigate, is the requirement that the new labels technology curre=
ntly requires the use of layouts (the drag & drop editor) Blogger Help: "You will also need to be using Layouts, since labels =
are not yet supported in the old template system." Looks like the sidebar m=
enu is the only part of labels that is unsupported, though, so that'll come=
. I think a bit of time will work out a lot of the kinks, & if we don't rus=
h to switch, it will all be OK when we finally do! --Posted by John to Freshblog at 8/15/2=

I've been reading about the new blogger beta with interest. I feel the new features are wonderful. But (there is always a but)... I am wondering if I will be able to use my old template, which I have grown fond of, and add some of the new features. I like editing my template's html/css and want to continue doing it.Also, does anyone know if we will eventually be forced to change? So far I've been sitting tight. I haven't switched because somewhere it said you can't go back. Anyone else have these concerns? --Posted by anniebluesky to Freshblog at 8/15/2006 04:31:20 PM

More importantly, they expose the tag construct through in the URL:?label=bloggerAnd the date search ranges:?updated-min=2006-01-01T00%3A00%3A00-08%3A00&updated-max=2007-01-01T00%3A00%3A00-08%3A00&max-results=1I was worried it would all be done with smoke, mirrors and obfuscated serial numbers.

ReadingI subscribe to around 50 blogs and news sources in =
a stand-alone feed reader (awasu). None of these sources relate to blog hac=
king. I like to actually visit these blogs (Freshblog, Singpolyma, ecmanaut=
, 3spots, The Last Word, Hackosphere etc) in a browser.Why? Two r=
easons. Firstly, I'm much more likely (20%?) to read/make comments on these=
 blogs. My feed reader (plus the state of mind induced by the rapid gorging=
 of information) doesn't lend itself to reading/making comments.S=
econdly, many of the articles are about newly-minted hacks that are being d=
emoed in situ, requiring a proper browser experience to appreciate t=
hem.PublishingWhile my two blogs receive roughly=
 the same daily web traffic as Freshblog, they get about 5% of the subscrip=
tions. That's the nature of the content.Across both, my email sub=
s are about a quarter (through Feedblitz, since they partnered with Feedbur=
ner). This is relatively high, but due to the content, most of the readersh=
ip are barely computer-literate. The next-most popular method is =
Google Desktops, followed by FireFox Live bookmarks. "Other readers" makes =
up 30% of my subscriptions.Since setting up an automatic comments blog and running it through Feedburner, I've=
 found that about 20% also subscribe to the comments feed.Hmm, as=
 a long-time FireFox user, perhaps I should avail myself of the live bookma=
rks feature more? --Posted =

Waaahooo! This is way too cool.

Oh man, remember all the roundabout ways that we got this working?

Heh, yeah it didn't let me switch mine yet either. And probably a good thing. It doesn't look like the new features are completely compatible with old templates. It looks like they need a new template setup to function.I did create a test account to play with and first impression is, well it's what everyone's been wanting.Categories, New archiving (all post titles available on the page), Drag and drop template widgets, gui color/font changing, comment feeds, private blogs. There's a lot to take in.Sniff, makes most of  our carefully crafted Blogger hacks obselete in an instant. As long as everything keeps working as advertised it's a nice job indeed. I'm impressed, although I reserve the right to change my mind later. :-) --Posted by phydeaux3 to Freshblog at 8/14/2006 08:53:49 PM

And believe me, I don't subscribe to any other blog through R-mail. Yours is something special :)And I have Live bookmarks for several feeds.

I would suggest basing a standard upon an already common practice rather th=
an inventing a new one, guaranteed not to be used by anyone, except any exp=
licit adopters.Today, the Blogger template defacto standard for w=
here to find the blog post content is in a div whose class attribute contai=
ns the word "post", in some form (or, in XPath terms, //div[contains(@cl=
ass,'post')]). In practice, this particularly fits three very=
 (and possibly evan most) common variants on the theme, class=3D"=
post-body", class=3D"post" and class=3D"post three", and =
given how CSS works, it would be a lot of work for blog authors to change t=
he class attribute not to include any other names but "entry-content".=
My (Hoodwink druid's) tip, thus: lax it to contain post in the =

Hi!I tried to find where I could contact Singpolyma but gave up and came here.I like the Wrink idea very much, I wished there could be a ring like Hatena has.(http://ring.hatena.ne.jp/ all they squares at the bottom are rings, they have a button that pops up navigation, you can see one here http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kiss_the_bitch/, the button is the red-white-blue circle in the sidebar)I tried to install the ring code to a post (sidebar is too cluttered) and got and error when clicking, but I also fond it happened elsewhere.In case it's here: http://3spots.blogspot.com/2005/11/about.htmlPlease tell me what I did wrong, thanks.I must say it's not easy to understand on Ning, when it's written title, I didn't know what title.. --Posted by ycc2106 to Freshblog at 8/11/2006 03:41:51 PM

try editing the CSS in the beginning to change fonts and color and if you view source of the page (not in template edit) you can find the CSS that is linked(import@) for other styles to edit. you must host the external style sheet somewhere or paste it into the beginning of your template between the &lt;style&gt; and &lt;/style&gt;. --Posted by jerry247 to Freshblog at 8/10/2006 03:41:44 PM

Yes, John. It's high time that we improve the consistency of blog templates. Not just the post contents,  post title, post footer, comment contents etc should also be identified by unique class names. My archive browser hack was made possible only by identifying class names but it doesn't work with all templates due to lack of consistency :( --Posted by Ramani to Freshblog at 8/10/2006 01:05:11 PM

Greg, Just sometime back I found that bookmarklets can be added to the links bar in IE. By adding this bookmarklet to your browser, you can get related posts for any blog that you visit (including yours)!! Btw, I have tweaked the search operation and it shows better results now. I will update the results page for aesthetics and remove any wierd things like &amp; etc. Please continue to give me any suggestions to make this better. --Posted by Ramani to Freshblog at 8/10/2006 12:38:51 AM

Thanks for introducing my hack, Greg. I will try to tweak my search operation to get relevant posts only. But a certain level of dumbness is unavoidable, I guess. I like your bookmarklet idea very much. But I believe javascript in bookmarks works only in firefox, isn't it? IE users could use the demo page at http://anniyalogam.com/scripts/demo.php.Also, for firefox, i have created a bookmarklet.php which you could use instead of relatedposts.php to avoid javascript showing up along with results. --Posted by Ramani to Freshblog at 8/09/2006 05:45:59 PM

Greg, I see partly what you are saying. (The other part is Greek to me.) But I'm not using this particular instance to go to the del.icio.us site. I have a link in my sidebar which leads to a  "Table of Contents"for my blog. I want is to be able to display all of my post titles on that page, even when the number of posts exceeds 100. My reasoning for this...it gives readers one place to go on my blog to see all of the post titles. I'm not completely happy with the idea of browsing through the archives to find posts of interest, and I felt this method was the answer. At a glance you can see if any of the titles are what you are searching for. --Posted by anniebluesky to Freshblog at 8/05/2006 09:58:02 AM

Hi Annie,I'd suggest you'd need to do multiple "pulls" (eg del.icio.us/user/tag1 then del.icio.us/user/tag2 etc), merge the results and de-duplicate.Or, there may be a trick in the del.icio.us API to get more than 100 posts back. Failing that, you might be able to use the API to fetch them in 100-post chunks using the "date" limiter.But, more profoundly, who would want an uncategorised list of 527 posts? You'd end up having to use ctrl-f to find stuff anyway. Surely navigating via tag combos (on the delicious site itself) is more natural and useful? Or is there some other archival or transfer purpose to getting a big list on one page? --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 8/05/2006 01:27:00 AM

Greg, thanks. John also sent me an email about the tagging issue. About the limit of posts. I can't figure out how I could change anything in my situation. I use del.icio.us to make a previous post list. (see A del.icio.us way to make a previous post list)I did go into the post it's self and edit the number from 100 to 500. I don't know if that will fly or not. Do you think there is another work-around to get more than 100 posts listed? --Posted by anniebluesky to Freshblog at 8/04/2006 04:14:53 PM

Another quick question. I read a post here regarding Technorati tags, but can't find that post again. I thought it said that if you have tagged your posts using del.ici.ous, you don't have to tag with Technorati. Technorati will automatically pick up the tags.I was going to go through all my posts and tag with Technorati. But, if I read correctly, that is not necessary. Right? Would there be any benefit to 'double' tagging? I would be happy not to, as it would get crowded at the end of my posts. --Posted by anniebluesky to Freshblog at 8/04/2006 09:45:04 AM

Speaking of del.ici.ous! I have searched and searched, but cannot find my answer. Maybe someone here can shed some light. Does del.ici.ous have a limit? I had an email from a reader regarding a post I wrote on using del.ici.ous as a method of making a previous post list. He thought there was a limit of 100. From what I see, it is limitless. Is that correct? --Posted by anniebluesky to Freshblog at 8/04/2006 09:36:15 AM

Please, Singpolyma, look into making the whole thing easier and I'm sure people will take it up!Also, I've noticed that the published dates in my comment feed's RSS file all got reset to yesterday (1st of August). This is bizarre and not very helpful. It also seems to have affected the "updated date" in both the RSS and Atom feeds.Maybe it's something to do with being the first month boundary of a new blog? Maybe it's something to do with the failure to publish emails 100% reliably. Either way, it's annoying to lose date information like that.Has anyone else experienced this? --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 8/02/2006 09:11:19 AM

I needed a while until I figured it out... it just wouldn't reveal itself, =
without carefully reading on my side (I was a bit lazy, its so hot today).Depending on what to market, I think the basic idea is brilliant. =
Bloggers are all playful to a certain point and want special outstanding th=

k myself right now, I consider to give it a try - when I am finished they a=
re hopefully out of the alpha version and have it internationalized (to ent=

I think it's serving both readers and creamaid best, slashing through their=
 campaign to rip out the core idea or method in plaintext, for the crowd ge=
tting somewhat weary of web 2 and its marketing drums about the next five w=
eek Thing, and so on.Not to glum up the joys of good ideas or the=
 like, I just think those keen on betting a few moments of their time on th=
e potential of maybe being wowed by some flash demo would go there even if =
they got the few-seconds-long elevator pi=
tch upfront, and more of the rest of us might jump the hurdle of sharin=
g your joy offsite knowing that there is something to expect there that act=
ually interest us.I may be overly protective or uptight about my =
time, though I think many of those likely to dig into and do something with=
 tech like this fall in the same category. Not to mention preferring the me=
ssage in a voice we have a relation of warmth and familiarity with; that so=
cial aspect to wording a message that Creamaid can't compete with on their =
own. The tight bonds that knit the blog world together into something stron=
ger than marketing campaigns, however targeted, can measure up to. --Posted by Johan Sundstr=C3=B6m to=

Yes, I got a similar message from Blogger Support. Also, people on the News Group have reported seeing error messages from Blogger's mail service that seem to indicate capacity issues.On the plus side, my last four comments went straight through! Assuming a 30% "acceptance rate" (the average to date), the odds of that happening by chance alone are less than 100 to 1.

I figured out the ordering of the rss.xml.  Blogger places the most recently edited post on top, so to fix the ordering problem, I went through and "edited" the posts in the reverse order of how I wanted them to appear (oldest to most recent.)  Feedburner doesn't seem to be suceptible to this problem, but the feed doesn't seem as reliable either.Hope this helps the process along.  Again, thanks for giving us another reason to stick with Blogger. --Posted by Dave to Freshblog at 7/25/2006 03:52:52 PM

Hey John,Looks like RMail numbers dropped out of your total subscriber numbers for all the days you have seen the large drop from ~800 subs.  If RMail does not request the feed from us in a given day, or if they do without telling us the subscriber number, we can't count it for you.  I am not sure if this is something on our end or theirs but I will take a look and see if we seeing this same drop in other feeds.  Shoot me a note if you'd like to follow up sooner.

Em,To leave a line between the post and the tags, put a couple of hard returns at the end of your post (putting a blank line after your text) & leave your cursor on the last possible blank line when you click over to the HTML side. The tags get written in at the bottom of the content, so if there's a  space there, they get written in after the space. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 7/25/2006 09:41:18 AM

I am using PDF995 (free) and my company actually bought it for internal use. It works quite well, and as geoffrey coan said, it simply gets added as a printer driver so anything you can print, can be made into a PDF. The sponsor popup is not annoying anymore and I have learnt to wait a couple seconds for it to disappear before I can see Acrobat Reader open up the PDF. The only annoying part is that the software did not allow me to choose where I install it and got situated under C:\PDF995, which is something I don't like. Maybe there is way to change it, but for now, that is where I have it. --Posted by RPM to Freshblog at 7/25/2006 03:16:14 AM

Greg,I've got your hack up and running on disciplemexico.org after a few failed attempts due to missing the posted by information on my test.  I have to say, this hack is very slick indeed.  One question: how does hearsay order the individual posts?  I had sent several comments to my comment blog at the same time (yes I too had problems with blogger mail), and then I changed the dates of the posts to match the actual dates of the comments.  However, I have some comments showing up as "older comments" even thought they are only a matter of days old, while comments two weeks old are appearing on the main list.  Any suggestions on how to force hearsay to order my comments from newest to oldest? --Posted by Dave to Freshblog at 7/25/2006 01:19:47 AM

I've used the pdf995 as well, and there are many other freeware or adware conversion programs that operate just as Geoffrey relates.  The hard thing is to remember to watch out that, when you want to actually print out a document later, you don't forget to switch your printer selection off of pdf995 back to your real life printer.  I've ended up making a few pdfs that I hadn't intended to in my day, and on my ancient downstairs computer, waiting for it to cancel can take a while. --Posted by Tor to Freshblog at 7/24/2006 07:13:48 PM

Personally I've been using pdf995 for some time now to produce PDF files of booking confirmati=
ons and the 'how to find us' travel directions for our Brittany Holiday Gite.=
PDF995 installs as a printer driver so you can produce PDF's from any PC ap=
plication (I've used Word and Powerpoint with no issues) and other than a s=
ponsorship screen when you generate the PDF file there seems to be no limit=
ations.  The PDF file has no adverts in it for instance and you can certain=
ly produce large files (had to produce a 65 page PDF last week for instance=
).If you want to remove the advert then I believe the licence fee=
 is quite reasonable.Not connected to them in any way, just a con=
tented user ! --Posted by G=

Any particular reason you tried every kind of comment syndication except mine?  ;)  I suppose some people find the requiring XML well-formedness (which I actually don't quite do anymore, and never required XHTML validity, as some have believed), and really should rewrite it some to use Tidy or something and remove that limitation... but anyway, it provides JSON(P) out of the box and the URLs to actual comments.

Hi Annie,The good news is that your Hearsay is nearly good to go =
... I just tested your blog out with my comment feed:javascript:h=
earsay('http://speccy-comments.blogspot.com/rss.xml', 'recent-comments')There's just two points:1) Your comments blog is empty. I =
just posted a comment to Blog U and it doesn't seem to have made its way ov=
er. Can you please forward it manually, or otherwise get a couple of test m=
essages in there?2) When I tested your layout with my comment fee=
d, it only displayed the first comment. I wonder if this is because your "r=
ecent-comments" div is wrapped in UL tags? (Hearsay generates it's own UL t=
ags, with each post in LI tags ... you could "nest" that in other UL tags, =
but it might require CSS tweaking.)Just a bit more OCD in between=

I have the mail-to-blogger problems too. Even manual forwarding didn't make any difference. Some comments get through, but others don't. It seems entirely erratic. I hope Blogger sort that one out soon!As for the wonderful hack, I have one suggestion: To save space, can you make it so that the "older comments" replace the five that were previously showing (rather than being appended below them)? You could then have a "newer comments" button appear so readers can cycle back and forth. That'd be neat. --Posted by Richard to Freshblog at 7/23/2006 05:46:20 AM

@Hannelore: Macht nichts ... Anonymous comments are displayed (check out Speccy), but if Blogger is dropping some then you may have the=
 same problem as below.@Mina: Thanks! I've noticed that Blogger h=
as dropped some of my mails too. I've sent Blogger Support an email asking =
why. I suspected Blogger might see this as a splog (spam blog). But, it sho=
uld be saving the emails as drafts - which it's not, for me at l=
east.In the meantime, the dropped messages can be forwarded manua=
lly, which seems to work fine. (Hearsay ignores the subject line =
and any sigs you may append to the email, but it's probably a good idea to =
delete the "from: ... ", "to: ..." etc block at the start of the forwarded =
message.)I'll let you know when I hear from Blogger Support. --Posted by Greg to Fr=

Hi again :DI am wrong. The comments, for whichever previous pages, should always appear in the Recent Comments. I think the problem is in Gmail. I used gmail for forwarding the email from blogger to my commentsblog. I checked my gmail account, and I saw that from 2 comments I wrote, only one was forwarded to my commentsblog. I don't understand why. There's nothing wrong with the gmail filter, since the first comment I wrote got forwarded correctly and showed up in the Recent Comments in my main blog. --Posted by mina to Freshblog at 7/22/2006 08:59:20 PM

hi Greg,a very good hack. I've tried it on my site (http://j-mave.blogspot.com). At first, I got problem like anniebluesky did, but after I changed the .xml, it worked out fine.The problem is, it still doesn't satisfy what I want.

Wow! I just tried out what you said Kirk, and man! That is one of the weirdest things on the net right now!But yes, like I said, its a block right from their database, since you can see the same thing even in the AJAX Search.However, I'm a little confused.  The Google AJAX Search is not blog limited. It uses the 'site:' limiter, right? So then why does it return just one result, when a normal Google search with the 'site:' filter returns many?Meditate on this, I will... --Posted by Aditya to Freshblog at 7/22/2006 10:03:24 AM

Hi,Yes, it's working for you!The catch is you need to use the rss.xml feed, not the atom.xml one. I'll update the instructions to reflect that.I just tried out your comments by visiting my blog (with Hearsay installed) and typing this into the browser:javascript: hearsay('http://kommentare-matriarchat.blogspot.com/rss.xml', 'recent-comments');Worked like a charm. Sorry that's it taken more than the six minutes advertised ... it's entirely due to my bad instructions.You should be able to remove it from your public listing now. You can also offer the comments feed to your subscribers by putting one of those orange XML buttons on your blog pointing at this feed.Noch einmal, tut mir leid!Tschuess! --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 7/21/2006 10:28:27 PM

I'm sorry to hear that!The error means that Hearsay couldn't apply the regular expression that extracts the author and URL of the comment. Specifically, it's looking for (but can't find):"Posted by [blah] to &lt;a href=[blah]"towards the bottom of the post.RegExps are notoriously fiddly beasts. I had a look under your Blogger profiles for your new comment blogs, but couldn't see any.Perhaps if you post (or send to me) the URLs for your respective comment feeds, I can have a look at them and see why the script is falling over.Thanks for implementing the hack and giving me the feedback!-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 7/20/2006 10:11:03 PM

A few more things came up while I was tweaking.8. I really like p=

ay that they could take up the whole section instead of sitting on top?  I =
feel like it's sort of tacky to have the list of posts above a bunch of oth=
er posts.  Perhaps this could be accomplished by linking to an empty post a=
nd then adding the list of posts with a given tag?9. Also, is the=
re any way of using my delicious tag bundles on the blog?  I find they make=
 organization a lot easier.I know I've asked for a lot, so I'll t=
otally understand if your answer to a lot of these is a brief "it'll be in =
version 1.0" or something.  I hope you don't feel obligated to spend too mu=
ch time helping me.Thanks again for making this available.  If I =

Freshtags looks great; I hope I can implement it at some point.  You've cle=
arly put a lot of hard work into this, and it's paid off.I don't =
want to nitpick, but since this is in development, I thought you might want=
 to get feedback so you can improve it.  I'm really impressed with what you=
've put together, but there are a few things that I think could be improved=
.  I apologize if this seems ungrateful or redundant--I'm writing this so t=
hat you know your work is appreciated and have an idea of what your users m=
ight like.1. When the page "reloads" (or whatever it does), it ju=
mps back up to the top of the page (at least on my browser [firefox on a ma=
c]).  When the page comes back, the tagged articles aren't on the screen an=
ymore.  This will baffle most users.  "DumbLittleMan" seems to have figured=
 out a workaround, but I'm not sure why.  On his blog, jumping up to the to=
p makes a lot of sense.  Either way, I think that the option should be open=
 to lay users as soon as there's time to add the code for it.2. T=
his one is a little tricky.  I think there should be a way to put up your m=
ost common tags in alphabetical order.  I tried sorting alphabetically and =
limiting the number of entries, but instead of putting out the most common =
entries from the whole alphabet, it put out all the entries from the first =
few letters.3. Is there an easy way to modify the code so that de=
l.icio.us descriptions and/or tags are printed along with the titles?  Dumb=
littleman figured it out, but I think it should be in the code for the init=
ial setup so that laypeople can do it themselves.4. Putting the o=
utput in the main column (like dumblittleman did) is a great idea.  There's=
 a problem, though.  If I pick a common tag (e.g. "bush"), then it fills up=
 my screen with my bush articles.  That's fine, but if I click on one of th=
em and go to that article, "?&tags=3Dbush" is still in the URL and the user=
 will have to scroll down to get to the article.  If the user doesn't think=
 to scroll down, they won't find it.  There should be an option to make the=
 "?&tags=3Dbush" disappear after a link is clicked to solve this problem.5. This is more of a question than a recommendation.  Could I have =
two tag displays on the same page with different types and lengths?  What I=
'd like to do is have a short drop-down menu of my most popular tags (in al=
phabetical order) in the sidebar with a lnk to a post with an untruncated l=
ist of tags.  Is that possible?6. Some of the documentation could=
 be a bit clearer.  The "build" page would be much more user-friendly if it=
 defined "anchor" and "fixed" and so on.  I skipped right over the definiti=
ons initially and had to go hunting for them.  Also, as far as I can tell, =
"sub" isn't defined anywhere.7.  Another question.  Because it's =
share alike, is it legal/ethical to rip code from other people's freshtags =
implementations?Again, thank you so much for making this availabl=
e, and I hope these questions and suggestions help make the code even bette=
r than it already is. --Pos=

ghts," & if you come to Freshblog from a non-freshtags site & not from a se=
arch, that's what you see. You could set your tag to be "popular" & Freshta=
gs would list those posts by default. Freshtags will still respon=
d to passed tags and search terms, though, so this won't load for every use=

upgraded this way that engines don't crawl scripts, so the freshtags menu l=

too closely either!Hope this helps. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 7/=

I have a couple of questions.    First, what do the numbers after=
 the categories stand for? Some I figured out, but some I can't. One reads =
6/34. I think the second number is the post count. What is the first one?    Second. I didn't see this post until after I set up FreshTags. =
The way I read this, FreshTags automatically selects the x number of .... o=
ops. Nevermind, I just figured out the second question myself. I thought it=
 said that it would automatically show your most popular *posts*. But it sh=
ows your most popular *tags*. So that leads to another question. Can it pop=
ulate your most popular posts automatically? As it stands, I went in and se=

@Singpolyma: thanks for the heads-up.  I will make the default class "entry-content" in the next release. (I picked "post-body" since that seemed the most common in templates.)In the mean time, you can always "over-ride" the present default by explicitly setting:PostItemDiv = "post-body";before the PopMarks! script is loaded.@Venkataramani: Thanks for having a look at this ... I'm not sure what answer is either. I think apostrophes tend to crop up quite frequently in English too. I've googled around a bit without joy. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 7/07/2006 10:55:14 PM

Hi Greg,Regarding your comment in my blog about the string delimiter issue, I am lost too. I found that using ' as the delimiter helps because tags like BlogCommentAuthor have double quote(") in them. But single quote itself could pose a problem, true.

I'm a big fan of very harsh quality control, given projects and what not that I've been involved in over the many years and knowing the inevitable path that these things take (no control leads to a mess, a mess leads to something not useful). But this goes back to what the wiki admins want the wiki to be, and how you want to maintain it.  You can have user-editable pages that still have a sense of consistency and professionalism--that doesn't detract from it's wiki-ness. In other words, wiki does not have to be a synonym for "messy pile of unedited stuff."  I'd imagine you'd want the same rules applied to a wiki page as you would if it were a link on freshblog -- is it real, does it work, is it a hack.  But hey, i'm not an admin! :) --Posted by JM to Freshblog at 7/07/2006 12:58:45 PM

Great to hear it's working for you now.I'm not too fussed about Speccy Sux - but I am worried that my code contains a JavaScript bug that is contagious!Given my lack of a Safari testbed, I'm  not sure how to progress this. Perhaps I'll just wait for the next release of Safari to see if it copes better. That's a cop out, I know. But chasing down a transitive bug that affects some websites for a browser with a few percent market share (that I can't use) ... sounds like a bad weekend.Thanks for the tip off. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 7/06/2006 11:10:08 PM

I figure a user-editable "bloghacks request page" is always going to be a giant public skip bin (=dumpster) of ideas. If blog hackers wish to "dumpster dive" for ideas in it, then we'll have to accept that there's going to be a lot of detritus, redundancy and mystery goo stuck to the bottom.In that spirit, is there any point exercising quality control at all? Sure, a few handy headings might help - the equivalent of a "glass, cans and cardboard go over here, no heavy metals or explosives please" sign - but ultimately, it's probably not worth enforcing.In the end, the market will work; coherent, insightful requests with wide appeal will get actioned while the inscrutible and baffling will be neglected.Or am I being too harsh? --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 7/06/2006 11:02:03 PM

Now I'm totally baffled.  I added the code to my actual blog, and it works f=
ine in Safari, just like it does here, at 3Spots, and at 404.But.=
..If I go to my test blog or to SpeccySux with  Safari, the butto=
n doesn't work.  And whatever the problem is there then carries over to oth=
er sites so that if I go to SpeccySux and then to my blog, it won't work at=
 either place.The code you suggested does keep the page from gett=
ing messed up, but it also keeps the bookmark icons from loading.=
You might want to look into this for Speccysux's sake and to prevent future=
 problems, but I think it's essentially fixed from my perspective.Thanks again for all your work. --Posted by Disenchanted Dave to Freshblog at 7/0=

Aditya is right, but one thing to keep in mind. If we are talking about tag=
s that need to be spidered by technorati et al , they need to be static as =
technorati won't index javascript created links. So you'd have to take that=
 into account methinks.Another possiblity, is using a little CSS =
creatively you can make it appear that the tags are in the footer, m=
atter of fact I think I know someone that does that. :-) Sample LinkIf you look, the technorati tags=
 appear as if they are part of the footer, but they are still in the body o=
f the post... just rearranged/styled with CSS. Moving the tags beneath some of the footer content might be a problem, but getting them in the s=
ame general vicinity isn't too hard. --Posted by phydeaux3 to Freshblog at 7/04/2006 08:0=

Publius,You have to edit your copy of the script that sits on your webserver before you install it. Open it in an editor and replace the **username** section with your actual username.

Hi Dave,It seems that Safari doesn't like the insertion of the po=
pup element. It looks like instead of inserting the HTML element (absolute =
positioned DIV), it's opening it in a new window.I've had a look =
at the excellent Qu=
irksmode website to find out if there are any known compatability issue=
s. No luck. I've had a look at how you've installed it (eg put script insid=
e another HTML element?). All looks fine. I'm starting to run out of ideas =
...Just to confirm, are you saying it works fine under Safari at =
the following:* Freshblog* Speccy Sux* 404 Errors* 3spotsBut not here:* Disentest blogIs that right?One last test. It could be the URL being o=
f a "javascript: ..." variety that is causing a problem. Could you please r=
ight click on one of the PopMarks buttons on your blog, copy the URL (eg ja=
vascript: popList('1', 'txtURL ...') and then paste it into your address ba=
r. Before you press enter, please insert btnsFetched=3Dtrue; ie=
javascript: btnsFetched=3Dtrue; popList('1', 'txtURL ...')No=

Waldwicht,Not possible, as best I can tell, although I will happily ask the community to prove me wrong. The thing is, your byline elements are static & part of your template, & can't easily be changed each time you post without a 100% republish. The part that updates each time is the post content, & so the easiest way to tag is in that area. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 7/03/2006 05:54:25 PM

Hi, I'll do my best to show you what happens.When I click the pop=

screen.  The popmarks button then works correctly, so that if I try to =
bookmark something, there are no problems.  So the code works fine in terms=
 of bookmarking, but it screws with the page.It's probably signif=

 over the screen, but I don't know exactly what that means since I know not=

I'm not exactly sure what I did, but I fixed the color problem above (I think I may have needed to use foreground and background for some reason).The safari thing is still baffling me.  It works on your blog and on 3spot but not on mine.Thanks again for your help. --Posted by Disenchanted Dave to Freshblog at 7/03/2006 01:15:46 AM

Hi, this looks really great.  I'm in the process of redesigning my blog, an=
d this looked great.  I've done my best to implement it, but I'm still gett=
ing some problems.In Firefox/Camino, the background doesn't show =
up and I'm left with the icons floating in an empty box.  (Weirdly, when I =
preview the page in firefox, the background is there.  It's only on the act=
ual page that it disappears).In Safari, clicking the button takes=
 me to a new page with only the button and my blue background.  Clicking th=
e button then gives me a correctly-formed box (with the background).There isn't a huge hurry because the rest of my new template isn't ready=
 to go anyway, but I'd appreciate any help you could give.  I'm testing out=
 my new template here.Thank you so much for making this available.  I can=
 show you my template code if you need it.Dave --=

Thanks, Drew.There's a couple of points:1) Your icons i=
n the popup are quite spaced out - if you don't like that, you can change i=
t by modifying the CSS img rule's padding.2) The PopMarks! script=
 is failing for you on your posts that contain an apostrophe ' in the title=
. This is because the function gets passed the title as a string, and the s=
tring is enclosed in single-quotes:makeMark( ..., 'Summer bound (=
Friday 5's)', ...);You can get around this by using double quotes=
 " to delimit strings:makeMark( ..., "Summer bound (Friday 5's)",=
 ...);But then, double quotes inside post titles won't work. Give=
n that you seem to have a "Friday 5's" series, perhaps this option is the l=
esser of two evils?I don't know what the proper solution to this =
problem is though; using backslashes in the string isn't the answer since i=
t won't look right as normal text. Any real JavaScripters out the=
re got any suggestions?In a similar but more tractable vein, one =
your global variables is defined:blogTitle =3D 'The Denson's';You can change to double quotes:blogTitle =3D "The Denson'=
s";3) I thought the defaults not over-riding might be due to them=
 not being defined as global variables (ie defined outside of a function). =
But that's not the case. The only way that boxColBG could get reset to "pow=
derblue" is if it is of type "undefined" when the PopMarks! script is run. =
But that happens immediately after the global variable is set to something =
else!I can only guess (hope?) that it might have something to do =
with the JavaScript errors from the errant apostrophes above that is causin=
g this. It's weird. Unless the OnLoad JavaScript error is playing a role?Try putting in the double quotes as described and see if the proble=
m persists.Thanks for the gentle f=
reedbacking ... --Poste=

Are you saying it's broken (error or failure), or it is unchanged?If it's the former, it might be that those parameters are entirely fanciful - there is no such domain as "mydomain.com" and I don't think there's (yet) a "german" tag for services auf Deutsch.For colours, try using any of the W3C standard names.If it's not "over-riding" the defaults with the new ones, then I'm a bit stuck. Certainly, 3spots is "over-riding" successfully to change the set of buttons, background colour, activation URL etc.A URL for your blog would help me out too ... --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 6/29/2006 11:34:08 PM

I think that's absolutely right. There are some people who are honestly disinterested in learning any html or css. Blogging seems to me to require more knowlege in those areas than using a decent WYSIWG editor to create static HTML pages. Blogging really isn't likely to be fun for most people who don't enjoy at least a little geekishness. --Posted by zenyenta to Freshblog at 6/28/2006 09:49:12 PM

You can use CSS in your template head to style it. I had to use multiple lines.... 1 controlled the menu, & the other fixed the blogger nav-bar that went crazy when I added the line for the menu!

I left this comment at JTSang as well:It is a little frustrating =
to implement hacks into Blogger, particularly when I know next to nothing a=
bout Javascript. I considered moving to another Blog platform, but I though=
t this: If Blogger is owned by Google, I think it's safe to say that at som=
epoint soon, they will integrate a lot of the features that other Blog plat=
forms have in the near future. I'd rather not get set up with another blog =
elsewhere, and then move back to Blogger after these changes are made. I us=
ed to Blog back in the day, a few years ago, and just recently started blog=
ging again. The tremendous amounts of change that occurred were difficult t=
o keep updated with, ie, RSS/XML, Categories, Trackbacks and backlinks, etc=
. Trying to learn about all these with a limited system is a little frustra=
ting.Something else to note about the limited file-support: Not only d=
oes Blogger only support pictures, but there is no easy way to stay on top =
of that. Theres no list of uploaded pictures in the Dashboard. The only way=
 to access the link to the picture is when you upload it in a particular po=
st, and then you link to it from there. Theres no way to keep track of them=
 all in one place--they are spread out all over your posts as you use them.=
 I've had to upload pictures in a post, copy the links to them, and then de=
lete the post just so I can use them elsewhere, ie, my sidebar or template =
in general. Quite annoying. --Posted by Jen to Freshblog at 6/21/2006 12:51:39 PM

Hi Kwoozy,I think I see the problem - when you click on a category, it should list out underneath in the sidebar all the posts that match that category. (It will leave the rest of the page intact ie not change the main posts listed.)But you need to use the code from the buildpage for that. Something like:&lt;script type="text/javascript">titleHTML = listTitles("list", 20, "Please Select ...", "posts", "");if (titleHTML)   document.write('&lt;h2 class="sidebar-title">Posts&lt;/h2>' + titleHTML);&lt;/script>Hope this helps.-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 6/14/2006 10:04:55 PM

Hi there,I'm going to have to ask a very silly question, so please don't shout at me...Is it possible to customise the arrow button and scroll bar for the dropdown menu?I've managed to change the colour of the text/background etc using CSS, but the usual codes to change the scrollbar don't seem to work. I've read somewhere that this isn't possible, and that the only way to go round it is to use Flash or Javascript, but I'm sort of a noob at this sort of thing and thought it best to ask the gurus.Thanks! :-) --Posted by Charme to Freshblog at 6/04/2006 10:55:48 AM

Hello alto.artist,That's a bit of a puzzler. Your post pages and =
your main/archives are different in that your post pages don't have FreshTa=
gs or archives associated with them. Usually that's achieved with the MainO=
rArchive tags - perhaps you could send me a copy of your template and I can=
 have a look at it? Just copy'n'paste it from your Blogger edit template pa=
ge into a text file and send it as a .txt attachment.As for the a=
rchive thing, from what I can see you have correctly tagged the archives in=
 delicious. I guess you saw John's post on FreshTags ar=
chiving! In your header, where you set FreshTags' parameters, try setti=
ng the archive variable to your archive's name:archive =3D 'oncha=
nting_archive';That should do it.OK, please send the te=
mplate and let us know how the archives are going. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 6/01/2006 11:45:31 =

With the way Blogger works realistically you have to depend on javascript redirects or something...  I'd like to keep the old posts at least existant so permalinks still work and just do a js redirect... but if search engines penalize that it might be worth looking into blanking out the posts or something... --Posted by Singpolyma to Freshblog at 5/29/2006 04:34:38 AM

In my billiard site, I have a billiard blog, that I wanted to blend in, thus, not having the nav bar would have been a benefit to me.  I found a happy medium.  I leave the nav bar as is, but when someone loads the blog, it loads scrolled perfectly just to where the nav bar is above the sight.  If the user wants it, they simply scroll up.Add this line to the body tag: onLoad="document.location = document.location + '#top1'"andAdd this to the title (if wrapped in the 'a' tag): name="top1" (if not wrapped in the 'a' tag, then do that as well) --Posted by billiardsforum to Freshblog at 5/26/2006 10:23:24 PM

Emily, Had the same problem myself a while back. Greg & Stephen both developed CSS for the stylesheet in your template head that will rein in the dropdowns and select boxes. Addselect { width: 10em; }to your stylesheet, & change the number to suit your template. For more, see Greg & Stephen's comments on another Freshblog post. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 5/25/2006 03:09:30 PM

Excellent synopsis, John!I'd add that it's a good idea to leave your old blogger-generated archive on the main page, by enclosing it in MainPage and noscript tags:&lt;MainPage>&lt;noscript> ... &lt;/MainPage>&lt;/noscript>This is since the FreshTags archive is dynamically generated - and hence invisible to search engine spiders. This means search engines may miss your crucial archive pages.You just need to have one (hidden) non-JavaScript archive somwhere on your main page and the spiders will still be able to get to it. Putting the hidden archive on the rest is superfluous and adds to page download time. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 5/25/2006 02:25:50 AM

Hmm, this advice seems to be in contrast to the Search Engine Optimisation crowd. I understood their rule-of-thumb was to leave the old site up for a week or two (to ensure spidering) but then immediately pull it down. Why? Apparently, modern search engines penalise duplicate content. Since they can't tell which is the "real" one, they assume the second one is fake (or a splog) and punish it in the rankings. However, if the second one is legit, then only the owner can take down the first one, so they check to see if the first one still exists. Got it? Search engines assume dupe sites are bad, unless the original is removed.How can we reconcile these two points of view? --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 5/24/2006 01:35:04 AM

I had accidentally imported my blog into wordpress at some point, and what it (WP) did was created a link to the wordpress blog on my blogspot blog. Redirection from the main page is probably the safest bet to not have sploggers take over your brand, your goodwill and the like. But as for the problem with the post page links, I have no idea how to maintain those - I guess if you migrate, you better have a good reason to, and you should be prepared to bite that bullet once and settle down on the provider of choice/comfort. As for me, despite all its shortcomings, I am sticking with blogger :-) --Posted by RPM to Freshblog at 5/23/2006 07:10:22 PM

I love this method.  I tried several other category methods (using blogsearch, caterblogger), but this one is the best for me.  I had a problem after I retagged my posts to fit categories and none of the new tags were showing up on my old posts.  I contacted Technorati, and although they said they couldn't help, a few days later it looked like they did a new crawl of my site, my tags were updated, and I was off and running.  Thanks a million!http://robotsandwrestlers.com/ --Posted by Santo to Freshblog at 5/23/2006 06:43:47 PM

very good advice. additionally, if a splogger takes over an abandoned blog, you can get it back -- posts intact -- by emailing customer support and saying something to the effect of "deleted my blog, splogger took it over, can I get the old one back" and -- because it's a splog -- the answer is yes.  May not always be yes, but I know of several personal bloggers who were able to successfuly get their host & posts back.  I guess there's a snapshot made when you delete it, one that can be retrieved. --Posted by JM to Freshblog at 5/23/2006 05:30:41 PM

Hi John,At first it seems like a great way to say "Hey, look, my site is popular." But, I could see some not so wholesome sites exploiting the system by linking to you from every page of thier site, thus eventually getting a high spot on your list. Unless the sitemaster can block certain sites from showing up, I'd take a raincheck. Great blog! --Posted by Harmony to Freshblog at 5/23/2006 09:10:32 AM

I've tried 1s and 1ass but it didn't look right. And 1grammarnatzi is to long.I know it isn't as big as your scripts and it's only css1 but it works. The sad part is that the missing (s) makes people think about other things as posting the comment. And of course the page gets bloated from it. lol --Posted by Gaby de Wilde to Freshblog at 5/22/2006 02:24:30 PM

Indeed - a great hack in that it avoids dragging users off to Google's blogsearch page.

Hi, I've been looking around for a tiny hack that I've been trying to figure out how to do.  It's a bit of an anal detail, but I'd like the "comment(s)" (or, in my case, thought(s)) to reflect, grammatically, the number of comments I have.  So 0 thoughts, 1 thought, 2 thoughts...How do I add that 's' for when blogcommentnumber != 1?Much appreciated! --Posted by somimi to Freshblog at 5/20/2006 10:16:04 AM

I just implemented Freshtags, and was having trouble with the scrolling option.  I wanted to limit the rows to 10 and have the user scroll through the rest so it does not clog up too much of the screen when results are retrieved, but the scrollbar did not seem to be activated, and the number of posts just ended up being truncated. I gave up and am now displaying it in "List" Mode, and asking readers to scroll down.Still nice, but was hoping to implement the first solution.---Friedbeef.com  --Posted by James Yeang to Freshblog at 5/14/2006 02:54:16 AM

appears to be just like a UNIX timestamp - time in seconds from the epoch e=
xcept with either extra precision (milli/micro) or some randomness thrown i=
n by blogger. Not sure which.This was useful for me because I cou=

y could have seen is older than the last post on the archive page that was =
just loaded and forward to the next archive page if so.It can als=

Geez, can't a guy even go to sleep around here? ;-) This is aweso=
me!! What a great way of showing the inter-relationships between blogs / us=
ers / sets of bookmarks. On Nicolas' request for synonyms... This=
 is the big kink in folksonomy as a system, isn't it? Great to be able to u=
se your own tags & mark your own stuff in a way that makes sense to you, bu=
t not so easy then for other folks to find it? Seems to me that controlled =
vocabulary, or a folksonomy thesaurus that took tags,  grouped them into fa=
milies and enabled apps like this (& like Freshtags) to grab or read relate=
d tags would reduce the dynamism / creativity in the system, but would boos=
t the power of tag-passing between accounts a great deal.... It should be p=
ossible (by which I mean the software ought to begin to allow us) to grab "=
soccer" tags from North American accounts and Football tags from European a=
ccounts & display them together... We discussed this w/ the tag-passing at =
Freshtags.... How does my del.icio.us tag find and  cooperate with your del=
icious tag? Social Software... The Next Generation!! =

Hi Nicolas,That's a toughie. Automatically discovering near-synonyms is certainly doable (statistically, "car" and "automobile" show up together a lot). But it's probably a tall-order for a JavaScript button.I'd be surprised if there's not already a website out there that takes two delicious usernames and returns a "common" tagspace plus stats about similarities.What specific purpose did you have in mind? Trying to decide whether or not to clone someone else's tagspace? Getting a better feel for unfamiliar tags? --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 5/08/2006 09:54:03 AM

What might be very useful is to be able to "fuzzy cross" one's interest with some other's.aka, I have tags like automobile, you have tags like cars,  how can we reduce our grammars without losses, or with acceptable losses of generality ?NR --Posted by Nicolas to Freshblog at 5/08/2006 09:08:25 AM

I'm a proud user of the first iteration who has converted to d2b.  I've done it a bit differently than the procedure works out since I already had a two blog structure at disciplemexico.org. My category post sits on a different blog than the  posts themselves, but the concept is basically the same, and the results, now with RSS feeds available for categories, are excellent. --Posted by Dave to Freshblog at 5/07/2006 10:08:12 PM

Hey John,thanks for your detailed and insightful reply! =3D)I thi=
nk you just summed up the current status of category blogging.--o=
ptional reading--The reason I'm looking for a category system that dis=
plays not the links to the entries, but the full entries themselves in the =
main blog body, is because the blog that I want to start will be an image/p=
hotographs blog, which will feature short entries with 1-2 pictures at most=
. Basically: lots of short entries with 1-2 pictures at most, and only=
 little text. Displaying links to the entries (whether in the main body or =
somewhere else) would only lead to more clicking, so I figured that display=
ing the actual entries in the main body would be more visitor-friendly for =
an image/photo blog.Long story short: thanks!I'll give label=
r or wordpress a try, since they seem to support the display of full entrie=
s in the main body after clicking a category.phew --Posted by Anonymous to Freshblog at 5/06/=

A rather general question on blog systems & categories:I'm new to blogging. I didn't know that categories were such a huge problem and require hacks. I always thought that categories in blog systems were a matter of course.My question is: am I right to assume that no public "dynamic" blog systems exist yet, that can automatically rebuild the blog page according which categor a visitor clicked?Let's say a visitor clicked category "A" on the category list (or category pull-down-menu). The whole page would then rebuild itself, only showing blog entries relevant to category "A".I hope my question was clear. =o --Posted by Anonymous to Freshblog at 5/05/2006 02:07:43 AM

I have another idea for categories on blogger.(is by making archives. Look at my blog: Stupid Stuff, you will understand) The only drawback I care is this: the posts on the manin page are not categorised and when I categorise them I have to change their date, with this I lose some links. I think this can be solved with some javascript that can let me choose which posts to apear on the main page.Anyone who know how to do that please email me.This is my blog: http://stupid-ideas.blogspot.com/and this my email: ionut.ro at gmail.comP.S. excuse my english, is not my first language --Posted by Stupid to Freshblog at 5/04/2006 05:07:31 AM

@John: I edited the hack, so that it only checks the comments div element. That basically means that the implementer is free to use any html tag he/she wants, but has to keep in mind to include the 'id="comment"' attribute. The same can be done with a 'class' attribute too, but then the function will have to be edited to look for the class! --Posted by aditya to Freshblog at 5/03/2006 02:25:20 AM

Andrew,Sign in to blogger, & select change settings > formatting. At the top of the formatting page is a section titled "show." To show 2 posts on the main page, change the dropdown over from days to posts, & select 2 as the quantity. Your recent posts list will still show the titles of the previous 10 posts. There will still be 1 post on the post page, and your archive pages will still show everything from the given month, but the main page will only show your 2 most recent posts.... Hope this helps.... --Posted by John to Freshblog at 5/02/2006 04:37:27 PM

Hello, and welcome too!I'm not sure I understand your question: are you saying that you only want to limit it to one post per tag?In any case, your template isn't writing out the post titles. Ie when you select a tag, there's no code to generate the list of post titles. You'll need to paste in the "listTitles()" code from the FreshTags build page.Hope this helps. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 4/28/2006 09:06:48 PM

Yep ... you can update the post-count in the archive with the magic archive bookmarklet as often as you like.My new thing is to update last month's at the start of each month, and create this month's at the same time. Err, if you catch my drift. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 4/28/2006 10:07:23 AM

great ork @ freshblog!
Hi John,
Great stuff you are doing. I've linked to various parts of your site and to
the site as a whole in my new blog over at
http://wassertanzen13.blogspot.com/ I picked as a category for my new blog
"blog improvement" (or blog-improvement) on technorati. I was quite
surprised to find that I'm practically the only poster currently with that
tag. I'd appreciate it greatly if you'd take it away from me ;~} since I
don't really have a clue what I'm doing (except following along as best I
can). Tom

Just shamelessly lifting a snippet from my earlier comment=
s on Tor's blog:Are you planning to put on some topic-spec=
ifc RSS feed buttons too? Maybe you could tag the URLs (eg http://del.icio.=
us/rss/MisterTor/pseudoscience)  in delicious, using the tags "RSS_feed pse=
udoscience" or similar. That way, readers can browse feeds by topic (select=
 "RSS_feed" tag on your blog or in delicious) OR when they pick a topic ("p=
seudoscience") the RSS feed will be listed as well.Another si=
de effect: since delicious make all your categories available as rss feeds,=
 people could subscribe to your blog's micro-feeds!http://del.ici=
o.us/rss/MisterTor/RSS_feedThat way, people who are constantly wo=
ndering "Wow - what new spin-off feed will he hive off next?" can subscribe=
 to the above URL, and as you create new micro-feeds for the blog ("kittens=
", "Zen" etc), they will be informed through this "master feed". Naturally,=
 they can then subscribe to the micro-feed:http://del.icio.us/rss=
/MisterTor/kittensOr not. :-) --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 4/27/2006 10:29:28 PM

Cool.

@Sam - Blogger's postIDs are probably handed out centrally by their server,=
 rather than being a cunning combination of blogID and timestamp. But if th=
ey are figuroutable - well, I'd love to know how!@Peter - Sorry, =
not familiar with blog template names. How about a link?@John - S=
hould be fine with archive URL of http://blogfresh.blogspot.com/ (note trai=
ling slash). Might be tougher for the script to figure out which are the ar=
chive links for those using the plain link list method. If so, I might need=
 to make some changes to the script to look for the word "archive" somewher=
e as well.Oh - and by all means make the URLs say next/prev or fo=
rmer/later or whatever makes sense for your blog. That stuff's entirely in =
the template, not the script, so can be freely changed. --Posted by Greg to Freshblo=

Hi Adi,Yeah, it might be best to sleep on it :-)Seriously though, you enter your blog main URL (http://the-lastword.blogspot.com/), the archive URL (in your case, the same ie http://the-lastword.blogspot.com/), select the archive method (FreshTags - good on you!) and paste in four massive chunks of template goodness.Honestly, what could be simpler? The other stuff about magic floating buttons is only for the curious and is an optional (dubious) part of the hack.Yes, FreshTags is still actively under development.

Hi Sab,In her sidebar, she fetches a JavaScript from ma.gnolia:http://ma.gnolia.com/js/none/people/jcmeloni/tags/extension%2=
0how-to/?length=3D20&byline=3Dtrue&title=3DHOW-TOs%20(EXTENSIONS)This script (click on the link above to see) has some bookmarks in it (=
URLs point to ma.gnolia). It then spits out HTML that makes a list of those=
 bookmarks. When you click on them you momentarily go to ma.gnolia before b=
eing redirected back to Julie's blog. Why? Not sure. Perhaps she =
wanted to keep those posts sticky.=

Greg,Thanks for steering me in the right direction.  I've discove=
red that the FreshAds load fine if I remove the Amber Alert crawler.  I exp=
erimented to see if I could get them to be happy together, to no avail.  Yo=
ur refresh function seems to do the trick, so I'll implement that.  It's al=
so good because now I can scrunch the same catalog of recommended books int=
o a smaller space.By the way, if we can refresh the FreshAds with=
out refreshing the whole web page, is there a way to do that with the Fresh=
Tags area itself?Adi,Another difference between these A=
mazon ads and the AdSense ads is that these are products that I myself am r=
ecommending to my readers.  The ability to steer them to the diverse intere=
sts of my readers helps me to have fewer ads cluttering up my layout.  More=
 room for content.  As it is now, I have Amazon ads for Buddhists, Libertar=
ians and folks interested in evolution.  While some folks may be like me, a=
nd have a healthy interest in all those areas, I suspect most of my Buddhis=
t readers won't click on an ad for a Libertarian book or magazine, unless I=
've succeeded in getting to them. :)Thanks again, guys!=

Hi Adi,When it comes to matching ads to readers (via content), I =
say leave it up to the professionals - in this case Google's AdSense.FreshAds is aimed at people running a catalogue - like Tor - rather than offering =
up adspace for rent to all-comers.FreshAds "adds value" (in busin=
ess jargon) by increasing the chances of showing a relevant ad to readers. =
More precisely, it allows the pubisher to narrow the pool of candidate ads =
based on an individual reader's interests. Since "catabloggers" like Tor (a=
nd me) have to pick out ads and maintain a catalogue anyway, delicious is a=
s good a way to manage that as any.That's why it currently works =
only with Amazon. Conceivably, something good be rigged up to work with eBa=
y and other product-specific merchants.In that sense, I guess it'=
s more like an e-commerce plugin, like a shopping cart, than an banner adve=
rtising engine like AdSense. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 4/14/2006 12:43:52 AM

@Greg: Reading your post again, a question popped up! How many people do you think will be willing and active enough to keep posting ads to their del.icio.us account? The whole simplicity of Adsense being that Google does all the heavy lifting, when we have to just enter a bunch of code and forget it.With freshads, one will constantly have to think if a page the person is visiting is worthy of appearing as ads on his site? Making browsing and surfing a little less fun by making people money minded, aren't you? :P(I'm sorry, but i've been hooked on to making codes and hacks easier for the common man to understand and implement!) --Posted by aditya to Freshblog at 4/13/2006 11:36:31 PM

@Benjamin: I'd like you to test this little CSS change in IE too. I don't know if IE's CSS handling will allow this, since Fx's handling is inherently the best of the pack of browsers, and IE's is the worst. --Posted by aditya to Freshblog at 4/13/2006 11:32:05 PM

Hi Tor,Checked out your blog - yes, you've followed the bloated a=
nd half-arsed instructions to a tee.You can check this for yourse=
lf by typing this into your address bar once your page has loaded:javascript:loadFreshAds()You'll notice that the spinning =
disc is replaced with a suitable ad. (BTW, you might want to think about us=
ing an alternative graphic against that background.)The reason th=
at it's not doing this once your page loads is that some other rude script =
is overwriting the "loadFreshAds();" call. You can see by typing this into =
your address bar:javascript:alert(window.onload)=
You get something about N2RunHandlers? No idea what that is - and my knowle=
dge in this area is very patchy to say the least - but that's not what I ge=
t on my blog.What is that something? It could be a blogspot thing=
. I use the Blogger NavBar (by choice) so it's not that. Could be HaloScan =
or some of the other scripts you've got running?I suggest you try=
 moving the FreshAds code further down the head. If that doesn't work, you =
could try to find out which script is overwriting. If that doesn't work ...=
 well, you might find someone more clued-in *cough* to help out.Here's another=
 suggestion: why not rotate your banner ads? You can put this code into you=
r head along with your other FreshAds code:function reFreshAds=
(interval) { loadFreshAds(); setTimeout('reFreshAds('+interval+')', interva=
l)};Then, somewhere at the bottom of your page[*], put this:&lt;script type=3D"text/javascript">reFreshAds(30000); // int=
erval in milliseconds&lt;/script>This way, every 30 seconds =
a new (randomly selected) ad will get loaded into the slot. Cool, huh? OK, =
probably not the safest way to do a repeating timer, and it's not very effi=
cient in that it will hit delicious again ... but these are blog hacks!If you want to expand FreshAds to deal with multiple ads on the page,=
 just create more target divs (named eg "FreshAds2" etc) and add these line=
s to the end of your doFreshAds() code:var outputHTML=3DlistAd=
s(adsObj);document.getElementById('FreshAds2').innerHTML =3D outputHTM=
L;Should do the trick.Let us know how you get on.Cheers,-Greg.[*] If you get the onload event ha=
ndler thing sorted out, it doesn't matter where you put this. -=

Hi,I'm trying to get this to work at Tor's Rants, but can't quite seem to get it to work.  I think I've followed your instructions to the letter.  For right now, the loading thingy is inconspicuously at the bottom of the right-hand column.  My delicious links for the ads are here. Is there something else I was supposed to modify, or did I modify something I was supposed to leave alone?Thanks,Tor --Posted by Tor to Freshblog at 4/13/2006 04:35:34 PM

Yep, all you need to do is add the following line to the FreshTags initialisation bit in your header:defs = "defaults";Of course, you change defaults to be the tag that makes sense for your blog. In the absence of any reader-selected tags, FreshTags will show any posts you've tagged with defaults.If you leave it blank ie:defs = "";then FreshTags will not display any posts if there no tags are selected. By why waste an opportunity to showcase your compelling content to your readers? --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 4/13/2006 12:46:17 AM

I modified the blogger hack.  I put the CSS and javascript in my template j=
ust like they advise to at blogger help:show/hide links but I chan=
ged what they did in between the [blogger] tags. Instead of putti=
ng their [span class=3D yada yada] [/span] stuff in the template, I enclose=
 what I want hidden in my post in that code, changing the "$BlogItemNumber$=
" stuff to an individual name for my post.Then I put the link ([a=
 href=3D"javascript:expandcollapse('name here')"] at the end of the post.What this does is allow an expandable post right on the main page, =
instead of jumping to a post page.  It also shows the link only on the post=
s that I want to expand, and I can choose how much I want hidden.=
One drawback that Aditya noticed was that the link is still present on the =
post page, when it really isn't needed, and it requires more code to add to=
 your post than just the [hide][/hide] that he is working on.  Al=
l in all, however, I find the drawbacks minimal compared to the benefits. --Posted by Triet to Freshblog at 4/11/2006 11:54:07 PM

The previous commenter has it right.

Advertising is not for everyone. Certainly, the vast majority of blogs don't use it. That said, I think that commercial messages can be a useful and welcome addition to a blog - if done properly.For example, have a look at ecmanaut's book recommendation - it's a natural fit with his blog.To display code in HTML, try using the &lt;code&gt; ... &lt;\code&gt; tags. If your blog editor chokes on tags, you can always substitute the open-angle bracket and close-angle bracket with &amp;gt; and &amp;lt;.-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 4/08/2006 03:24:09 AM

G'day Phil,Always pleased to see a fellow Radiohead fan join up. Checked out the tag wall and it's an interesting take - a sort of stand alone tag app rather than integrated into the sidebar.For another take on tagclouds, check out phydeaux3's work. And if you want to go down the "tag-driven search engine" path,  have a look at Singpolyma's version of FreshTags.One last thought - have you thought about using FreshTags' "multi-list" mode? That way users could select "piracy+games" etc.Cheers,-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 4/06/2006 09:32:29 PM

Hey John, I don't suppose you could post an explanation of the "Highlight author/owner comments" hack here on Freshblog? As a non-techie, I've managed to utilize a lot of the hacks here, but this one has thrown me for a loop. Love the blog. --Posted by Ariel to Freshblog at 4/05/2006 10:40:32 PM

He Triet!1) I'm not aware of any automated method to do this. I w=
rote a brief overview for tackling this pr=
oblem that might be helpful. If you come across any other approaches - or j=
ust want to explain your own tactics - please add a comment.2) I =
hadn't thought about the cookie angle. FreshTags doesn't use any cookies wh=
atsoever. To my knowledge, delicious only uses them to "keep you logged in"=
. But, when requesting the JSON object, FreshTags passes your username. So =
there is no reason why cookies are needed to get the JSON feed either.=
I just did a little experiment by turning cookies off and requesting:a) My =
delicious homepageb) My delicious JSON feedc) My =
FreshTags-enabled blogAll seemed to work OK.Could t=
here be some other way that the ISPs are blocking FreshTags? Could you ask =
people in that predicament if they can repeat the above experiment?Cheers,-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 4/05/2006 09:03:09 PM

Hey guys, I just joined the club.  So far I've tagged one post with ecmanau=
t's greasemonkey tagging method and just downloaded the freshtag script.  L=
ooks great!Here's my blog:  thebleedingear.blogspot.comQuestio=
ns:1. I know I read somewhere about an easier way to go back to old po=
sts and tag them without having to repost them all.  Can anyone point me in=
 the right direction?2.  Many of my readers come from Vietnam.  Some I=
SPs there block blogger/blogspot, so they must use IP maskers.  That blocks=
 cookies, which disables freshtags (and my recent comment hack) b/c del.ici=
o.us uses cookies.  Is there ANY way to set it up without relying on cookie=
s so that my blocked readers could benefit from freshtags?Thanks =

For you it's all Perl, Python, Ruby, shell scripts, URIs, bookmarklets and the like."I can't count the number of hacks or tweaks that I've seen in this blog that are all about glueing different services together.

Greg turned me on to Extreme Tracking recently (better for search term searches, I think?) and of course Performancing are working on public stats from Metrics too, which will porbaby become the gold standard since it is blog specific... They can't keep a comment count for blogger yet, but then again, neither can sitemeter! I would recommend Metrics, I think, based on the fact that it is still growing & has been developed specifically for blog application. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 4/03/2006 05:09:48 PM

Anon,You can put it wherever you like. As a straight swap-out, it should replace the bloggerprevous items tags.... You can comment them out, insert the new code, and preview your page so that the changes aren't irreversible. It can go anywhere you like, though, so experiment 'til it looks good w/ your template! --Posted by John to Freshblog at 4/02/2006 04:26:57 PM

Hi John,Try this in your style sheet#SideLCol ul { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; }to recenter your post titles that appear from the FreshTags Topics navigation.I've been playing with PsycHo for possible Tor's Rants implementation so I can finally have a footer that doesn't float up onto or under the side columns on individual post pages.  The template I'm using now doesn't seem to allow clear:both to work since the side columns are absolutely placed, and only the center column is relative.Peace,Tor --Posted by Tor to Freshblog at 3/28/2006 10:08:08 PM

Well BB, I never said YOUR code wouldn't work as it was, I said i=
t WOULD work since there were really two tags.I said there would =
probably be an issue with the OTHER sites code, which only had the one form=
at in a blog search url (that ain't my code, that ain't my site)A=
s you yourself explain in your own posts on the matter, the format for the =
blog search url and a technorati crawled url are different, which is why yo=
u went to using two tags in the first place right?? You stated yourself in =
partone and two that getting technorati to correctly index a tag in ONLY th=
e blogsearch url format was sporadic at best.Which I was agreeing with=
 you!I think if you want to combine the blogsearch and technorati=
 tags, the way you originally setup is best since it has the format for bot=
h done correctly, and will probably work over the long haul more predictabl=
y. As you know technorati is notoriously buggy sometimes, even with using e=
xactly their supplied format. But whatever works.But just to clar=
ify my original comment that you seemed to think meant your method wouldn't=
 work, just the opposite. I said it would work. :-D If you want to trim it =
down to the one tag and that works for you, then great also. I'm just ag=
reeing with what you said, in your own post about that, the blogsearch =
url isn't in the format technorati likes to crawl and add to IT's tag index=
. So I wasn't contradicting you, I was agreeing with your origina=
l two tag format. :-DIf using your new one tag format works for you an=
d everyone else consistently then I'm all for that as well. Cheer=

No rain over here. Just to make sure that I'm not crazy I used a simplified=
 version of the code similar to what I discuss in Part 1 of my tutorial. Here is my code:< a href=3D"=

_url=3Dyourdot.com&x=3D40&y=3D10" rel=3D"tag">yourkeyword< /a=
>And I posted it from my test si=
te.Low and behold it works and was indexed by Technorati here. I=
 can't speak for 'phydeaux3' because I never heard of the site before today=
 or used their code but obviously it works for me. It could perhaps all com=
e down to Technorati's notoriously buggy indexing.So there you ha=

Not to rain on anyones parade, but I'm pretty sure the format on Skeptic Rants ain't gonna work as Technorati tags. They work fine as links to the google blog search, but they won't also be crawled by Technorati. Just adding a rel="tag" bit to it ain't enough. Technorati figures out what the 'tag' is not by the anchor text, but by the last entry of the href...and the format for a blog search Technorati just won't be able to pick up.The format on Instablokes will work for both, but because it's really two sets of tags for each, with the Technorati tag being invisible (no anchor text)Although I don't know about adding those links by hand. I would make greasemonkey or a bookmarklet do the heavy lifting. :-) --Posted by phydeaux3 to Freshblog at 3/27/2006 08:09:59 PM

I like the new, sleek, Freshblog look. WRT drop-down select box width, try adding this to the CSS:select.showtag{       width: 10em;}(FreshTags' assigns the select element to the "showtag" class. The above CSS statement tells the browser to resist its instincts and cap the width control.)For your non-FreshTags drop-downs (ie archives), you could just put the code in directly:&lt;select style="width: 10em;"&gt;Of course, people who know more about CSS/HTML than me are free to jump in here :-)-Greg.ps.

Not bad, but the narrowness makes it annoying on my big screen -- all that content you've got squished into a comparitively small space.  Faster-loading than the old template though :) --Posted by Singpolyma to Freshblog at 3/27/2006 06:49:36 AM

"Since the search URL doesn't end the right way to be crawled by T'rati (so why are we adding the rel=tag to it again?), you have to deploy a second stage of nested-link hackery to fool the crawler...alright... so now I don't get it..."Hi John. So what part don't you get? Technorati crawls it just fine. In fact it works better than ordinary tags out of the box. I've been using it for months now and it works perfectly so why not give it a try for yourself.Cheers!...BB --Posted by BB to Freshblog at 3/27/2006 02:20:08 AM

Overall, the new sleekness is refreshing.  Just one major issue that I'm seeing (Firefox and IE): the dropdown menu fields for the archives/categories and the mailing list field are a bit too wide for the sidebar.  Maybe just tweak the template code to reduce the width of those forms a bit.  Good luck with the new theme. --Posted by Googlist to Freshblog at 3/26/2006 09:04:47 PM

Well John. I am using a template that I created using the tool from Psycho and it has been great till now.Out of so many templates I have used, this tool allows me to actually decide how big my sidebars going to be. There is a great deal of flexibility especially for someone who don't have the time to weed through the xhtml codes.The only thing that I noted is that when I tried to open my blog using Firefox and IE, wthe bullets on my previous post is out of the box when I open with Firefox. IE has no such problem. --Posted by Balajoe to Freshblog at 3/26/2006 06:59:05 PM

 blog template images for a few weeks or months now already -- just upload =
them in the post editor, extract the URL and use it in your template instea=

Would you consider a wiki for this? There's quite a few reasonable, free, hosted wiki solutions out there.

Noodle,Your template is divided into 2 parts... The head is the stuff that the computer can see but isn't on the monitor, the body is what's on the monitor. You should see html & head as pretty well your first 2 tags, & then, later a closing /head tag followed by an opening body tag that marks the transition between computer / server stuff & cool stuff that people can see. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 3/09/2006 10:27:36 AM

Thanks for explaining that "last updated" means the last time technorati crawled your site vs. the last time your blog was actually updated. I have been frustrated with this information provided by technorati because it is always way off the last time I updated. For example, I may make a post, ping technorati, and even 2 days leater it says my site was last updated 9 days ago. It is very confusing, because, to me, last updated sounds like the last time your blog was updated --Posted by Keith to Freshblog at 3/09/2006 07:14:26 AM

" "News," "Event," etc.).  (My blog is about trial practice issues.) But th=
en when I searched for a way to add indexing to a Blogger blog and found Fr=
eshTags, I saw how easy it was to add lots of descriptors.So I ha=
ve the hybrid you describe. There are general categories that frequently re=
cur, and there are also tags for finer indexing. A case about the admissibi=
lity of evidence under Rule 404(b) is tagged with the broad category "Cases=
," the fairly common "Evidence," and the quite specific "404(b)." A post ab=
out a particular judge will have the general "Judges" and the individual ju=
dge's name.I call everything categories simply because that's the=
 way the bookmarklet labeled them and by the time I figured out that I coul=
d change it, I'd already invested time in tagging a lot of posts.  (Now my =
bookmarklet puts in "Filed as," which gets away from "Category.")=
If I wanted more purity (in terms of information science), I would distingu=
ish between categories and tags (or index terms), but I'm trying to just ge=
t the job done.I've been running my blog for over a year and I fe=
el familiar with the range of posts I've written, but I've found as I've go=
ne back to tag old posts that some topics recurred more than I expected. I =
like having the tags to pull them together. For instance, there have been s=
everal posts about sports cases, and some people might like being able to r=
etrieve them easily.I'm aiming for tags that would be useful for =
navigation within my blog, rathern than trying to find tags that would work=
 for people outside. That means I don't have some tags that, in another con=
text, would make perfect sense. For instance, I don't have a tag for "trial=
s" because the blog is about trial advocacy and almost every post has somet=
hing to do with trials. I don't have a tag for "Washington State" because t=
he focus is on Washington State.When I summarize cases about evid=
ence and trial procedure, I stick to tags that are about those topics. The =
case might be a trial for murder or child abuse, but the reason I'm summari=
zing it is to for the evidence question. (Putting in a lot of tags about th=
e aspects of a case about sex with children might draw visitors to the site=
, but they wouldn't find the site interesting and would leave quickly anywa=
y.)It's been an interesting exercise. And I think the tags will m=
ake the blog much more useful. --Posted by Mary Whisner to Freshblog at 3/06/2006 05:=

I also use furl, and i am quite amazed with their improvement. i mean delicions is the top dog when it comes to folsonomy, but furl is another kind of beast in its entirety, as its slogan says is more about the personal experience because it is more compulsive(it has a lot categorization and personal review to it) and about a complex bookmarking system very easy to use. --Posted by Craffter to Freshblog at 3/06/2006 06:21:44 AM

Wow - depending on how this is done, it could give every blogger the abilit=
y to put a customised, searchable, tag-driven, context-sensitive dynamic pa=
nel of news headlines, photos, links etc in their sidebar.No doub=
t, the Washington Post would not be unhappy that those links point t=
o the Washington Post. Here's an example of how it looks on their si=
te (just under their technorati box):http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/24/=
AR2006022401702.htmlHere's how it could look in your s=
idebar:http://ghill.customer.netspace.net.au/?tags=
=3DwashingtonpostOK, so that example is not much more excitin=
g than grabbing an RSS feed ... but when you start adding other tags like s=
ports, business etc then we could have a collaboratively filtered newspaper=

Thanks so much for your help/response, John. I think I have the categories linked to del.icio.us now. But I don't seem to be getting the pasting of the del. html code into my blog post in html mode. Where does that code need to go and what would it look like? I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong. But whenever I click on "categories" it takes me to del.icio.us and to my category, which I click on to find it doesn't work. Again, greatly appreciated and I will post a public thank you on the blog.Jayson --Posted by Anonymous to Freshblog at 3/04/2006 09:56:22 AM

Janine,I think you can edit the cloud code to add an anchor tag. That way, the posts that you wanted to add to the cloud could be tagged w/ a special tag (the name of your blog?) & posts that you didn't want to show up wouldn't be there. The only issue w/ this solution would be that your anchor tag would appear in the cloud & might be featured prominently because it was used so regularly. --Posted by John to Freshblog at 2/28/2006 05:09:02 PM

Hi Honel,FreshTags orders the tags in the same way as delicious serves them back. By default, FreshTags asks for them back sorted by frequency. In your FreshTags code you pasted into your blog, there's a bit that calls delicious. Here's Freshblog's:http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/tags/jrfj44/blogtech?sort=freq&count=100Note the "?sort=freq" - change that to "?sort=alpha" and it should do an alpha sort.http://del.icio.us/feeds/json/tags/jrfj44/blogtech?sort=alpha&count=100Just make that change in your header script and you should be right.Please reply back here either way so we all know :-)Cheers,-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 2/28/2006 07:43:57 AM

Hi Gabe,Let me preface my remarks by saying that I'm in favour of=
 having available a multitude of blog category methods, including search en=
gines (like Taher's), tagging (FreshTags), hosted feeds (Labelr) and built-=
in (Wordpress). They each have strengths and weaknesses. You know, let a hu=
ndred flowers bloom etc.(The only proviso is that I would not rec=
ommend any method that requires all the posts to be on the front page due t=
o scalability and load issues. Ditto for methods that requires maintaining =
multiple near-identical blogs for each category.)That said, I thi=
nk there are some persistent misunderstandings of the tagging method for ca=
tegories being promulgated.Firstly, it does NOT have to take your=
 readers to delicious. You can have your tags/categories point to internal =
links. This has been the case for at least four months now, since Marc Morales' sidebar hack.Secondly, the inclusion of tags on each post has been entirely automated =
by methods such as Johan's  greasemonkey script. For many readers, tags woul=
d be included anyway to gain visibilty in technorati.Please recon=
sider the tagging method - it is seamless and provides you with benefits th=
at come from getting your blog into a wider social context.-Greg =

Greg, I wanted to comment on a comment you left on Taher's sight =
linked here:http://www.blogger.com/publish-comment.do?blogID=3D21=
033509&postID=3D113745931183793118&r=3DokI posted the dialogue be=
low to his site, but I wanted to pass it to you as well:Here's wh=
y I don't like the delicious approach as a novice blogger.  First, as Taher=
 states, using delicious takes you away from the main blogger page.  Second=
, you have to do some editing to each post you make such that it works....y=
uck.  So far, Taher's method is one step better.  However, both fail on thi=
s account (Taher's method still goes away from your specific blog to the ge=
neral Blogger search site).  I'd love to have categories keep the reader ri=
ght in my blog.  Unfortunately for Taher's method (and I realize this may b=
e the only way to do it) I don't like having to prefix my entries with the =
category name either. It would be great if you could simply write your post=
, click what category you want it in and your done.  I'd love the category =
function to be seamless.  The delicious method just seems way to tricky sin=
ce you have to manually tag every post using manual coding.  For someone li=
ke me who wants only two or three catergories forming what I envision as a =
real "multiblog", it needs to be much easier.  I feel I jumped the gun by g=
oing with blogger, if wordpress does this automatically.  And, as so many h=
ave pointed out, this really is the only way to go if you want to blog a lo=
t.  Some of the best formats are www.tompeters.com or www.radicalcareering.=
com/hogblog/index.php.  I'd love for categories to be like that. =
As a side, I've asked for Amit's labelr application because it sounds as if=
 it might be just what I describe above.  My fingers are crossed.  Otherwis=
e, wordpress here I come (I'm not implicating you here.  I just think the b=
logger folks are idiotic for not including something so basic.)-G=

I made the experience that the offered link DOES NOT bring back the chosen style ... so it's not really reproducible after leaving this gorgeous little thing!!! --Posted by Markus Merz Photography to Freshblog at 2/23/2006 07:57:03 PM

del.icio.us tagrolls are cool, but in order to categorize my blog entries, I need to pick up only the tags related to my entries, not all of my tags, which include links to numerous other web sites. --Posted by Janine White to Freshblog at 2/23/2006 06:01:57 PM

i've added the script and it worked excellently! i've also added a tagroll from delicious, but i only want the tags relating to my own blog appearing in side bar. so i modified the javascript to point to http://del.icio.us/cissyn/myblog (i've used myblog as an anchor tag for all posts). something annoying is the tag "myblog" appearing in the tagroll, and swamping all other tags, just because it's the most frequently used tag! is there anyway around this? --Posted by CisSyn to Freshblog at 2/22/2006 08:51:19 AM

Video slots on =
the web has a fan club of there own, people just can=E2=80=99t get enough. =
Even when news slots are launched by the different software developers they=
 get a standing ovation and are attacked with an intensity of a wolf mother=
 protecting her cubs. It is like the New Years sale in Bond street where th=
e entire population of crazy housewife=E2=80=99s fight over every garment a=
nd will draw blood if need be.Lucky us the since the slots are on=
line there is no such thing as a queue and you can play when you want. You =
don=E2=80=99t even have to get dressed.Not that this has any rele=
vance to who plays slots and who don=E2=80=99t. There is clearly according =
to the latest polls more women playing slots then men. Men seem to drift to=
wards the poker and table games. But here is something us men have to watch=
 out for, they are coming. And they are also coming in swarms. An=
d since we men can not do more then one thing at a time (at least that is w=
hat the women say) we are in trouble. Take Blackjack, they should be better=
 at handling two and three hands then us. Texas Hold=E2=80=99em is up for g=
rabs because of the pace and many factors in the game. So when you are play=
ing against a women you might want to hold on to your chips (and maybe your=
 hart as well) she could end up owning both of them. Women know we are simp=
le beings, and do have this factor over us when playing face to face. All m=
en are suckers to a nice smile, so in all fairness any poker game that has =
both men and women in it should be played online. At least you wi=
ll not be distracted by that nice perfume drifting in from the women next t=
o you. It is so faint but a man has certain instincts and will try to get a=
 good sniff. So leaning in (ever so careful) I still get booted from a game=
 for trying to look at other peoples cards. And I had a straight lined up. =
Even the big smile I got from the women next to me did not really soften th=
e blow of getting booted. At least the dealer understood me and just told m=
e to take a break for a while. That is my 2 cents worth on the topic of wom=
en and gambling.Signing off for now and heading towards the slots=
, someone told me there is a good chance of meeting women there. At least t=
hat is what they tell me on http://www.streetslots.com --Posted by Latin's Lady to Freshblog at 2=

I think this project makes for a great labour of love and is appealing for =
people on the cutting edge of blogging. In terms of Google/Blogger purchasi=

 already enough, and publishing them as JSON feeds (or near-analog) too mig=

is on the backburner but he's promised to look into this later. I hope that=
 there's a fruitful cross-fertilisation of ideas, code and users in the nea=

Hi John,T'rati is definitely having some problems. Its tag facility is slower than molasses in mid February right now.

del.icio.us, and to make myself a little more accessible, I'll be
monitoring For:Freshblog on del.icio.us going forward. If you see good
Freshbloggidy stuff that you think I should see too, slap it on

adyta: Well, that is the thing, blogger already has all the capab=
ilities for categories, they only have to release blogger categories tags, =
and categories will be sorted out right out the archives without a problem,=
 the only categories factor they would have to add is to decide if they do =
it as sections categories, meaning they will let you add your categories bu=
t without tags sharing the same post right in the blogger system.=
or supporting tags and let you add a relative category that is indexed by t=
ags and called that way.Or even then , they could support both. i=
 bet that it will be the first  one and that the categories will be control=
ed. meaning you can only add 10-15 categories if you want to use blogger su=
pplied categories. or you could use Amit=C2=B4s Labelr service and have alm=
ost as many as you want i guess..and after amit just really opened the gate=
s, i can see other triying to follow suit.But i am all about supp=
orting the rogue coder at the lead, so lets cheer Amit and support his meth=

Hello everyone,I'm glad there are folks like you to help my reade=
rs find things they'll want to read in the archives of my blog.I =
put up the basic FreshTags on Tor's Rants last night, and have had real fun playing wit=
h it.  I've learned a lot about CSS and html from using Freshblog hacks.One thing I noticed, and that Greg alludes to above, is that it help=
s Google AdSense better target ads to my readers.  Since my postings are so=
 eclectic, it's really helpful.  That's a big selling point for widespread =
adoption of FreshTags.  It would probably encourage a lot more people to sl=
og through the CSS, or pay someone to do it for them, to include the FreshT=
ags.I'll be moving the FreshTags up to a more prominent spot on m=
y blog very soon, after I tame some of the other sidebar elements.  I'm int=
rigued by the prospect of tag-driven blogrolls.  In the meantime (by this w=
eekend, hopefully), I'm going to be collapsing my blogroll into categories,=
 to help people find the blogs they'll want to visit.I'll be happ=
y to include "FreshTags Users" as one of the collapsing categories, so send=
 out that code when you get a chance!Peace,Tor --Posted by Tor to Freshblog at 2/14=

Hi Amit,That admin view is beautiful!Just on the server side stuff, is it push or pull? I mean, do you have a script wake up and scrape your customers' blogs, or do they manually "post" it to your server by invoking some kind of script?Also, what do you reckon about the JSON/delicious/technorati integration? It's a natural fit with your web2.0 tech. Happy to collaborate with you on that one.Cheers,-Greg. --Posted by Greg to Freshblog at 2/14/2006 04:05:32 AM

Hi John, Its trivial to add or remove cteagories to your blog, or to apply/remove them from individual posts. A post can have multiple categories/labels. You can checkout how I manage them by going to admin  view of my blog.Greg: 5 in http://www.labelr.com/blog/3/label/12/post_data/5/ is not "post number", its the page number.On the server I store the content of the post, when you apply tags/labels to them for the first time, and you can imagine the rest. --Posted by Amit to Freshblog at 2/14/2006 01:03:38 AM

@rpm: probably what john was thinking (looks better, works sleeker) :Peven i've had to switch back to this comment view, but can't this page be made to open in a new window with the dimensions of the window set by javascript? its a cheap way of making it look like the previous comment popup, but this one might support coComment too! --Posted by aditya to Freshblog at 2/09/2006 04:41:11 AM

Ah! I had a vague idea that that was what you meant when you said del.icio.us doesn't support generic JSON.Since that is cleared up, it means asynchronous loading of the titles after tag selection can still be implemented, since JSON for individuals is supported?When is the next version (hopefully with async loading) coming out? (tentatively?) --Posted by aditya to Freshblog at 2/09/2006 03:56:35 AM

Hi Aditya,Yes, they do support JSON:http://del.icio.us=
/feeds/json/jrfj44/freshtagsBut only for individual ac=
counts. If you try to get everyone's bookmarks, you can't. Used to b=
e able to, but now they've turned it off.http://del.icio.us/feeds/j=
son/tag/freshtagsYou can still get everyone's bookmark=
s as an RSS feed, though:http://del.icio.us/rss/tag/freshtagsThis hacks take that RSS feed and pumps it through ejohn's rss2json conver=
ter and let's FreshTags carry on normally.Hope this helps!BTW, I do have a gmail address. While I don't publicise it, you could pr=
obably guess it. (HINT: you need to use the full Anglo-Celtic version of "g=
reg" :-)-Greg. --=

True enough, invitation codes get sent out within days.I made the=
m a better Greasemonkey auto-injector that auto-updates its configuration daily to always be in par with coComm=
ent blog service coverage. Works like a charm on Blogger and WordPress blog=
s, and as it uses the same system their own tool does, it should work with =
all the rest of them, too. --Posted by Johan Sundstr=C3=B6m to Freshblog at 2/09/2=

Yes, I got that too when I posted my last comment.  I'm trying to convince coComment to add support for the popup window ;)  For now what you can do is click the link for the popup window and then alter the contents of the location bar not to include &isPopup=true.  You will then be taken to the non-popup version of the page where you can post a comment and coComment will work :) --Posted by Singpolyma to Freshblog at 2/09/2006 01:38:37 AM

@John: I do see a link for 'Show Original Post' on the flat comment page. I think I like this view better because by default it shows the current comments and I can switch to see the actual post when I want to. I don't know what I was thinking when I switched to pop ups :-) --Posted by RPM to Freshblog at 2/08/2006 08:58:53 PM

I have started from my oldest post and am tagging bit-by-bit every time I g=
et some time. My steps:1. Log in to my blogger account in Firefox=
.2. Since blogger dashboard does not allow me to go all the way to the=
 bottom, I actually open a new tab and go to my blog and open up archives a=
nd go to the earliest period. 3. Once I have all the posts for that ar=
chive, I open each post with the 'edit post' pencil icon in a new tab. 4. I am using the greasemonkey script for tagging to delicious (through th=
e link field). So when I open the post for editing, I can simply enter the =
tags and publish. 5. Then I link to delicious using the link generated=
 after publishing.6. Close that tab and go to the next post and repeat=
. It is quite slow and tedious, but I don't try to do too many at=
 once. And I am in no rush to get all done. Earlier, I had simply=
 done searches through my dashboard for certain common topics/keywords that=
 I write about, and tagged them separately. So I know I have taken care of =
some of the important posts. --Posted by RPM to Freshblog at 2/08/2006 08:55:51 PM

You can always do as on some assembly required and offer both modes of co=
mmenting to your visitors. I actually find it kind of wrong that blog owner=
s decide this preference setting, rather than the visitor, but the web isn'=
t always too concerned with the preferences of the end user.Come =
to think of it, it surprises me I haven't made a Greasemonkey script to pic=
k a Blogger comment page style I prefer yet. --Posted by Johan Sundstr=C3=B6m to Freshblog at 2/08/2006 08:31:14 PM

I was never a big fan of this comment entry page, since it doesn't look anything like my blog, doesn't contain my original blog post by default, and doesn't make a lot of sense to me in terms of layout.... I switched over to the pop-up as soon as they offered it because it seemed smaller, neater, meant that my post was still visible, and looks much better... esp. for people who are used to using Haloscan etc. Have a renewed interest in Stephen and Johan's inline comment forms... if we can get CoComment to work with them... --Posted by John to Freshblog at 2/08/2006 07:40:06 PM
